          <p>Our National Performance Framework and Economic Strategy set out our vision for sustainable and inclusive economic growth.</p>
          <p>We want Scotland to be a leader in the technological and social innovations of the future. We will harness that innovation to boost productivity and business competitiveness, improve lives for the better across all of Scotland, and to export our solutions, goods and services to the rest of the world.</p>
          <p>Competitive, innovative businesses focused on best practice, leadership and management are vital to delivering this vision. They support sustainable jobs, incomes and our quality of life. We will work in partnership with business so that we can deliver the kind of economy that we want.</p>
          <p>The actions in this plan will put Scotland at the forefront in transitioning to a carbon neutral, circular economy. They will modernise transport and energy systems, achieve and maintain world class connectivity and harness innovation to create and scale successful businesses, while tackling key social challenges like the changing demographics of our population and the associated challenges of skilling and reskilling. These issues apply across our cities, towns and rural areas, as well as in our islands. In doing so, we will create opportunity for every business, individual, family, local community and region in Scotland.</p>
          <p>We have listened carefully to the views of business, employer organisations, trade unions and other stakeholders across Scotland. The actions we are taking reflect strategic priorities that we and our stakeholders believe will enhance the conditions in Scotland to thrive.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Government defines inclusive growth as: “Growth that combines increased prosperity with greater equity; that creates opportunities for all and distributes the dividends of increased prosperity fairly”.</p>
          <p>We are taking action in the following key areas to make sure the fundamentals are right:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Investment:</strong> boosting private and public investment and delivering world-class infrastructure.</li>
          <li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> streamlining business support and ensuring a competitive business environment.</li>
          <li><strong>International:</strong> growing exports and international investment and attracting global talent.</li>
          <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> supporting world-leading innovation and a dynamic digital economy.</li>
          <li><strong>Skills:</strong> providing a highly skilled workforce through education, training and re-skilling.</li>
          <li><strong>Place:</strong> supporting thriving places throughout Scotland: in our regions, cities, towns and rural areas, including our islands.</li>
          <li><strong>People:</strong> moving toward a world-leading working life where fair work drives success, wellbeing and prosperity for individuals, employers and society.</li>
          <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> seizing the economic opportunities of the transition to a carbon neutral economy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We will take these actions forward in a way that reflects our unwavering commitment to delivering inclusive growth across all of Scotland.</p>

          <p>Scottish industries are already responding innovatively to some of the most significant challenges of our time: dealing with rising demand for health and social care; transitioning to a carbon neutral economy; rapid technological change and automation. These are enormous challenges for society but also provide opportunities for those who develop the solutions.</p>
          <p>We are also taking action in strategic areas to harness these opportunities, drive up investment and innovation, and mark Scotland as a leader on the world stage.  For example, we are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Accelerating our transition to a carbon neutral economy:</strong> a £60 million Low Carbon Innovation Fund; a £20 million Energy Investment Fund; investment in electric vehicles infrastructure and in the circular economy.</li>
          <li><strong>Driving transformation in industries at the forefront of innovation:</strong> through investments in advanced manufacturing, life sciences and financial technology.</li>
          <li><strong>Delivering a 5G strategy:</strong> to stimulate markets in high-data products and services and underpin our progress in areas like connected devices, machine learning and Internet of things.</li>
          <li><strong>Supporting data driven innovation:</strong> through Innovation Centres such as The Data Lab and Censis.</li>
          <li><strong>Investing in AI technologies:</strong> such as a world leading clinical imaging data resource that develops AI applications for the public good.</li>

          <hr>
          <p>Scottish industries are already responding innovatively to some of the most significant challenges of our time: dealing with rising demand for health and social care; transitioning to a carbon neutral economy; rapid technological change and automation. These are enormous challenges for society but also provide opportunities for those who develop the solutions.</p>
          <p>We are also taking action in strategic areas to harness these opportunities, drive up investment and innovation, and mark Scotland as a leader on the world stage.  For example, we are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Accelerating our transition to a carbon neutral economy:</strong> a £60 million Low Carbon Innovation Fund; a £20 million Energy Investment Fund; investment in electric vehicles infrastructure and in the circular economy.</li>
          <li><strong>Driving transformation in industries at the forefront of innovation:</strong> through investments in advanced manufacturing, life sciences and financial technology.</li>
          <li><strong>Delivering a 5G strategy:</strong> to stimulate markets in high-data products and services and underpin our progress in areas like connected devices, machine learning and Internet of things.</li>
          <li><strong>Supporting data driven innovation:</strong> through Innovation Centres such as The Data Lab and Censis.</li>
          <li><strong>Investing in AI technologies:</strong> such as a world leading clinical imaging data resource that develops AI applications for the public good.</li>
          </ul>

          <hr>
          <p>We understand that Brexit presents real challenges for many of Scotland’s people, businesses and communities. These may be particularly acute for the rural economy given challenges around population, the supply of labour and the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
          <p>We believe Scotland’s future is best served by continued EU membership, in line with the wishes of the Scottish people as expressed in the referendum in 2016. However, if Brexit proves to be inevitable, our interests are best protected by the UK remaining inside the European Single Market and Customs Union.</p>
          <p>As we set out in ‘Scotland’s Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment’, membership of the Single Market and Customs Union delivers economic benefits to Scotland. Brexit will significantly weaken our economy and result in slower economic growth and lower incomes than otherwise. A Brexit which results in the UK being outside the European Single Market and Customs Union will have the most damaging consequences for Scotland.</p>
          <p>Leaving the Single Market and Customs Union would also compromise the vast range of common economic, social, consumer, and environmental standards that we have become accustomed to as a member of the EU. This is not acceptable to the Scottish Government nor, we believe, to the people of Scotland.</p>
          <p>We strongly believe that a commitment to maintaining membership of the Single Market and Customs Union would not only avoid a no-deal or blindfold deal that would be so damaging, but would secure a withdrawal agreement and provide clarity on the future relationship.</p>
          <p>Taking action to mitigate impacts, the Prepare for Brexit campaign, led by the enterprise and skills agencies, will help businesses review their plans in light of Brexit to ensure they can continue to develop their workforce, grow their business, export, innovate and access finance and investment.</p>

          <p>We understand that Brexit presents real challenges for many of Scotland’s people, businesses and communities. These may be particularly acute for the rural economy given challenges around population, the supply of labour and the Common Agricultural Policy.</p>
          <p>We believe Scotland’s future is best served by continued EU membership, in line with the wishes of the Scottish people as expressed in the referendum in 2016. However, if Brexit proves to be inevitable, our interests are best protected by the UK remaining inside the European Single Market and Customs Union.</p>
          <p>As we set out in ‘Scotland’s Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment’, membership of the Single Market and Customs Union delivers economic benefits to Scotland. Brexit will significantly weaken our economy and result in slower economic growth and lower incomes than otherwise. A Brexit which results in the UK being outside the European Single Market and Customs Union will have the most damaging consequences for Scotland.</p>
          <p>Leaving the Single Market and Customs Union would also compromise the vast range of common economic, social, consumer, and environmental standards that we have become accustomed to as a member of the EU. This is not acceptable to the Scottish Government nor, we believe, to the people of Scotland.</p>
          <p>We strongly believe that a commitment to maintaining membership of the Single Market and Customs Union would not only avoid a no-deal or blindfold deal that would be so damaging, but would secure a withdrawal agreement and provide clarity on the future relationship.</p>
          <p>Taking action to mitigate impacts, the Prepare for Brexit campaign, led by the enterprise and skills agencies, will help businesses review their plans in light of Brexit to ensure they can continue to develop their workforce, grow their business, export, innovate and access finance and investment.</p>
