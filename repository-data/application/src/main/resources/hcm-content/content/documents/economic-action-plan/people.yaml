          <hr>
          * **The [Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2017/6/enacted) sets out our ambition for reducing and ultimately eradicating child poverty**
          * **Spend on early learning and childcare will more than double to reach nearly £1 billion a year by 2021-22**
          * **£750 million over this Parliament to tackle the poverty-related attainment gap**
          <hr>
          <h2>Reducing Child Poverty</h2>
          <p>Our child poverty legislation, and the action plan ‘<a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/child-chance-tackling-child-poverty-delivery-plan-2018-22/">Every Child, Every Chance</a>’, focus on lifting children and families out of poverty, driven by our vision of genuinely inclusive economic growth. The plan is backed by a range of investments including the £50 million Tackling Child Poverty Fund.</p>
          <h2>Early Learning and Childcare</h2>
          <p>We have already increased the provision of high quality funded early learning and childcare entitlement to 600 hours a year for all 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds.</p>
          <p>We will more than double spending on early learning and childcare to reach nearly £1 billion a year by the end of this Parliament as we implement our commitment to provide a funded entitlement to 1140 hours of ELC for all 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds. This will improve outcomes for all children, especially those who are more vulnerable or disadvantaged, and help to close the attainment gap. ELC will also support parents to work, train or study, especially those who need help with finding sustainable employment. Increasing the entitlement will require a substantially larger workforce, significant investment in infrastructure, and new, innovative models of delivery.</p>
          <h2>Scottish Attainment Challenge</h2>
          <p>We will provide £750 million through the Scottish Attainment Challenge during the course of this parliament to tackle the poverty-related attainment gap to ensure that all our young people develop the skills required to thrive in life.</p>
          <h2>‘Scotland’s Enterprising Schools’</h2>
          <p>We are supporting Young Enterprise Scotland to deliver ‘<a href="http://enterprisingschools.scot/">Scotland's Enterprising Schools</a>’ to ensure a future involving enterprising activity is valid and viable for all young Scots.</p>

          * **The [Child Poverty (Scotland) Act 2017](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2017/6/enacted) sets out our ambition for reducing and ultimately eradicating child poverty**
          * **Spend on early learning and childcare will more than double to reach nearly £1 billion a year by 2021-22**
          * **£750 million over this Parliament to tackle the poverty-related attainment gap**
          <hr>
          <h2>Reducing Child Poverty</h2>
          <p>Our child poverty legislation, and the action plan ‘<a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/child-chance-tackling-child-poverty-delivery-plan-2018-22/">Every Child, Every Chance</a>’, focus on lifting children and families out of poverty, driven by our vision of genuinely inclusive economic growth. The plan is backed by a range of investments including the £50 million Tackling Child Poverty Fund.</p>
          <h2>Early Learning and Childcare</h2>
          <p>We have already increased the provision of high quality funded early learning and childcare entitlement to 600 hours a year for all 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds.</p>
          <p>We will more than double spending on early learning and childcare to reach nearly £1 billion a year by the end of this Parliament as we implement our commitment to provide a funded entitlement to 1140 hours of ELC for all 3 and 4 year olds and eligible 2 year olds. This will improve outcomes for all children, especially those who are more vulnerable or disadvantaged, and help to close the attainment gap. ELC will also support parents to work, train or study, especially those who need help with finding sustainable employment. Increasing the entitlement will require a substantially larger workforce, significant investment in infrastructure, and new, innovative models of delivery.</p>
          <h2>Scottish Attainment Challenge</h2>
          <p>We will provide £750 million through the Scottish Attainment Challenge during the course of this parliament to tackle the poverty-related attainment gap to ensure that all our young people develop the skills required to thrive in life.</p>
          <h2>‘Scotland’s Enterprising Schools’</h2>
          <p>We are supporting Young Enterprise Scotland to deliver ‘<a href="http://enterprisingschools.scot/">Scotland's Enterprising Schools</a>’ to ensure a future involving enterprising activity is valid and viable for all young Scots.</p>

          * **Helping parents into work**
          * **Closing the disability employment gap and the gender pay gap**
          <hr>
          <h2>Parental Employment</h2>
          <p>We will invest £12 million in intensive parental employment support to help parents on low incomes move into employment and progress their careers when already in work, as part of our focus on child poverty.</p>
          <h2>Gender Pay Gap</h2>
          <p>Our Gender Pay Gap Working Group includes expert stakeholders such as Close the Gap, Engender and the STUC. Chaired by the Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, the group will develop a coordinated cross-government action plan to reduce gender pay gaps across sectors, as a key element of the Scottish Government’s inclusive growth vision.</p>
          <p>The First Minister’s National Advisory Council on Women and Girls was formed as a catalyst for change to address gender inequality by providing independent strategic advice to the First Minister. Their vision is of a Scotland which is recognised as a world leader, for its commitment and action towards realising an equal society where all women and girls can reach their true potential.</p>
          <p>We will also commit £250,000 over two years to develop support and cultural change for Women in Agriculture, by delivering pilots in improving confidence of women, understanding your farming business and leadership development, improving training across the country for women involved in farming and crofting and developing a Charter for Equality.</p>
          <h2>Disability Employment</h2>
          <p>We will publish a Disability Employment Action Plan setting out steps towards achieving our ambition to reduce the disability employment gap by at least half.</p>
          <p>We will take a joined up approach across our public services to help people with a health issue or disability stay in work by piloting a Health and Work Support service. We also aim to provide 300 Allied Healthcare Professionals with National Institute of Disability Management and Research training so that they can support people to remain in or return to work as part of a 5 year programme.</p>
          <h2>Mental Health</h2>
          <p>We are enabling those in our hardest to reach, isolated areas who are suffering with mental health issues to engage with the jobs market and contribute to the economy through our support for the National Rural Mental Health Forum.</p>
          <h2>Health and Work Support</h2>
          <p>We are taking a joined up approach across our public services to help keep people in work by piloting a Health and Work Support service in Dundee and Fife, set to run until June 2020. This tests a single, easy to navigate, entry point for health and work services to reduce length of sickness absences and the risk of job loss.</p>
          <p>We will implement the recommendations of the Commission on Widening Access to support delivery of our ambition for 20% of entrants to university to be from the 20% most deprived areas by 2030.</p>

Their vision is of a Scotland which is recognised as a world leader, for its commitment and action towards realising an equal society where all women and girls can reach their true potential.</p>
          <p>We will also commit £250,000 over two years to develop support and cultural change for Women in Agriculture, by delivering pilots in improving confidence of women, understanding your farming business and leadership development, improving training across the country for women involved in farming and crofting and developing a Charter for Equality.</p>
          <h2>Disability Employment</h2>
          <p>We will publish a Disability Employment Action Plan setting out steps towards achieving our ambition to reduce the disability employment gap by at least half.</p>
          <p>We will take a joined up approach across our public services to help people with a health issue or disability stay in work by piloting a Health and Work Support service. We also aim to provide 300 Allied Healthcare Professionals with National Institute of Disability Management and Research training so that they can support people to remain in or return to work as part of a 5 year programme.</p>
          <h2>Mental Health</h2>
          <p>We are enabling those in our hardest to reach, isolated areas who are suffering with mental health issues to engage with the jobs market and contribute to the economy through our support for the National Rural Mental Health Forum.</p>
          <h2>Health and Work Support</h2>
          <p>We are taking a joined up approach across our public services to help keep people in work by piloting a Health and Work Support service in Dundee and Fife, set to run until June 2020. This tests a single, easy to navigate, entry point for health and work services to reduce length of sickness absences and the risk of job loss.</p>
          <p>We will implement the recommendations of the Commission on Widening Access to support delivery of our ambition for 20% of entrants to university to be from the 20% most deprived areas by 2030.</p>

          <hr>
          <p>To attract talent to Scotland and grow our population (including as part of the repopulation of our rural areas) we need a migration system which reflects Scotland’s distinct needs. The recent report from the Migration Advisory Committee confirmed evidence from the Scottish Government about the positive impact of EEA nationals to our economy, our public services and our communities.</p>
          <p>We will continue to push the UK Government to recognise the action that is needed to protect Scotland’s prosperity and wellbeing. Scottish Ministers should have the powers to tailor migration policy, within a UK framework to meet Scotland’s distinct needs.</p>
          <h2>‘Come to Scotland’ campaign</h2>
          <p>We will now build on the success of the ‘We are Scotland’ social media campaign to launch a ‘Come to Scotland' campaign to attract talent and investment.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will bring forward an Electoral Franchise Bill to give fair access to voting rights for all those who have a legal right to live in Scotland.

          * **Significant investment in our health services and workforce**
          * **Tackling health inequalities**
          <hr>
          <p>The Health and Sport portfolio is responsible for over £13 billion of resource spend annually, and we have continued our record investment in our NHS as part of the commitment to increase health funding by at least £2 billion over the lifetime of this Parliament. This spend includes significant investment in research and development, digital infrastructure and capital investment, all of which contribute to provision of apprenticeship opportunities, high quality employment and applications of new technology.</p>
          <h2>High Quality Healthcare</h2>
          <p>Delivery of high quality and timely healthcare is essential, and ensures that our workers are able to remain economically active through improving health and reducing health inequalities. We are taking significant steps to close health and economic inequalities, and we are exploring financial and regulatory measures which have a universal and preventative effect in tackling the burden of disease. Achieving the current target of 4% sickness absence would generate an additional 500,000 working days annually.</p>
          <h2>NHS Scotland</h2>
          <p>We will promote recruitment from more deprived areas to <a href="https://www.scot.nhs.uk/">NHS Scotland</a>, which is the largest employer in Scotland, with just over 6% of the workforce.  Including social care, this grows to 14% of the workforce, equivalent to 364,000 people. This employment is spread across the whole country, helping to sustain rural economies and generating local employment.</p>
          <p>Investment in pay across the workforce is a key lever to attract and retain the skills required to deliver a sustainable service. This investment means that over 15% of the workforce are higher rate tax payers. We have awarded 147,000 NHS staff earning under £80,000 a minimum pay rise of 9% over the next three years and we are implementing the new GP contract.</p>
          <p>The Digital Health and Care Strategy will be central in addressing the challenges and realising the opportunities we face in health and social care.  Investment in our digital infrastructure is in excess of £200 million per annum.</p>
