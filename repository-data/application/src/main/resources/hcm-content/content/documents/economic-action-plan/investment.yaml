          * **Our new National Infrastructure Mission will increase Scotland’s annual infrastructure investment**
          * **We are stepping up our engagement with the construction sector**
          <hr>
          <h2>National Infrastructure Mission</h2>
          <p>To maintain competitive economic conditions in an increasingly global market, and to deliver a long term boost to Scotland’s economy, we will drive forward a National Infrastructure Mission and steadily increase Scotland’s annual infrastructure investment until it is £1.5 billion higher by the end of the next Parliament than in 2019-20.  On current estimates that would mean around £7 billion of extra infrastructure investment by the end of the next Parliament.</p>
          <p>It is vital that the right investments are made that generate inclusive growth and deliver our carbon neutral objectives.  Investment in economic infrastructure is a key driver of growth. For example, investment in broadband, transport and utilities provides the foundation for companies to invest and brings new economic opportunities to remote and deprived parts of the country.  We will identify the priority infrastructure projects that can unlock the greatest productivity gains advised by a new Infrastructure Commission and through the development of the next Infrastructure Investment Plan.</p>
          <p>The chair of the Infrastructure Commission will be appointed shortly, and it will be asked to report to ministers on key strategic investments in Scotland to boost economic growth and support public services by the end of 2019.</p>
          <p>Following the completion of this report the commission will be asked to provide advice to ministers on the delivery of infrastructure in Scotland, including the possible creation of a Scottish National Infrastructure Company.</p>
          <p>As we step up our investment in infrastructure, continue to deliver on our commitment to 50,000 new affordable homes and take forward plans for the Scottish National Investment Bank, we will also step up our engagement with the construction sector to support its plans to develop and grow a more sustainable, productive and innovative industry and to enhance the sector’s contribution to the economy and employment and career opportunities across Scotland. In particular, working across procurement, infrastructure, economic development and built environment interests and with our enterprise and skills agencies, we will work with organisations such as Construction Scotland, the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, the Construction Scotland Innovation Centre and the trade unions to help the sector thrive and grow.</p>
          <p>Water is one of our most important natural assets, and Scottish Water will continue to invest around £600 million each year in our water and wastewater infrastructure, supporting jobs across the economy whilst providing 1.38 billion litres of fresh, high quality drinking water every day, and treating our waste water before returning it safely to the environment.</p>
          <h2>Construction Industry</h2>
          <p>Our ambitious infrastructure plans will rely on a construction industry that is both well positioned to deliver and understands the wider social and economic wellbeing priorities associated with that delivery. Working across government, we will take steps to form a refreshed and stronger relationship between government and the construction sector (including organisations such as Construction Scotland, the Civil Engineering Contractors Association, the Construction Scotland Innovation Centre and the trade unions) around a set of common goals to help the sector grow.</p>

          <p>Having already exceeded our target of 95% fibre broadband coverage across\

          \ the end of 2021.</p>\n<h2>Digital Economy</h2>\n<p>To ensure all of Scotland\
          \ can benefit from the digital economy, we will:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>invest £\
          25 million through the Scottish 4G Infill programme (S4GI) to deliver future-proofed\
          \ mobile infrastructure and services in up to around 60 to 70 complete mobile\

          \ digital maturity amongst businesses in every part of Scotland.</li>\n\
          </ul>\n<h2>Mobility as a Service (MaaS)</h2>\n<p>We will harness digital\
          \ innovation within our transport system through investing up to £2 million\
          \ to develop ‘Mobility as a Service’ (MaaS) in Scotland, with funding available\
          \ from 2019 to support projects. This will complement our existing work\

          \ products and services and enabling businesses and underpinning progress\

          \ needs.</p>\n<h2>Digital Scotland</h2>\n<p>We will also launch a promotional\
          \ strategy for Digital Scotland aimed at attracting investors, designers,\
          \ entrepreneurs and technical talent to think of Scotland as the right place\

          * **Deliver the second Strategic Transport Projects Review by 2020**
          * **Open the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route**
          * **Continue the A9 and A96 dualling programmes and construction of the £30 million A77 Maybole bypass**
          <hr>
          <h2>Strategic Transport Projects</h2>
          <p>Since 2007, we have supported our transport systems with over £20 billion investment across trunk roads, rail, buses, ferries and air services as well as active travel, including delivery of the iconic £1.35 billion Queensferry Crossing and the M8/M73/M74 Motorway Improvements projects. Building on this, the second Strategic Transport Projects Review will identify the strategic transport infrastructure investments required to support Scotland’s economy over the next 20 years.</p>
          <p>We continue to progress work on the A9 and A96 dualling programmes and spend £1bn per year supporting public transport, providing people with access to jobs and services.</p>
          <h2>Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route</h2>
          <p>The opening of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route will bring about transformational change which will improve business competitiveness and stimulate investment enhancing market conditions for key sectors, while helping to retain and attract jobs in those sectors, guaranteeing a fast link for freight and goods from the north east to markets in the south and expand labour catchment areas.</p>
          <h2>A77 Maybole bypass</h2>
          <p>The construction of the £30 million A77 Maybole bypass will remove a constraint on our important route to the ports at Cairnryan as well as removing traffic from the town itself, making it a better place to live.</p>
          <h2>Borders Railway</h2>
          <p>The Borders Railway opened in 2015. It’s the longest new line built, in the UK, for over a century, and takes passengers between Tweedbank and Edinburgh in less than an hour. Since opening, the line has had a significant economic and social impact on the area, with passenger numbers increasing each year through 4 million journeys. The Borders Railway is now attracting new workers, homeowners and tourists to communities served by the line.</p>
          <h2>Rail Stations</h2>
          <p>We are improving our major rail stations at Motherwell, Aberdeen, Inverness and Stirling and master planning with partners around others including Edinburgh Waverley.</p>
          <h2>Low Emission Zones</h2>
          <p>We are introducing Low Emission Zones in four cities – Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee – which will encourage investment in cleaner transport technologies.</p>

          * **Deliver the second Strategic Transport Projects Review by 2020**
          * **Open the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route**
          * **Continue the A9 and A96 dualling programmes and construction of the £30 million A77 Maybole bypass**
          <hr>
          <h2>Strategic Transport Projects</h2>
          <p>Since 2007, we have supported our transport systems with over £20 billion investment across trunk roads, rail, buses, ferries and air services as well as active travel, including delivery of the iconic £1.35 billion Queensferry Crossing and the M8/M73/M74 Motorway Improvements projects. Building on this, the second Strategic Transport Projects Review will identify the strategic transport infrastructure investments required to support Scotland’s economy over the next 20 years.</p>
          <p>We continue to progress work on the A9 and A96 dualling programmes and spend £1bn per year supporting public transport, providing people with access to jobs and services.</p>
          <h2>Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route</h2>
          <p>The opening of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route will bring about transformational change which will improve business competitiveness and stimulate investment enhancing market conditions for key sectors, while helping to retain and attract jobs in those sectors, guaranteeing a fast link for freight and goods from the north east to markets in the south and expand labour catchment areas.</p>
          <h2>A77 Maybole bypass</h2>
          <p>The construction of the £30 million A77 Maybole bypass will remove a constraint on our important route to the ports at Cairnryan as well as removing traffic from the town itself, making it a better place to live.</p>
          <h2>Borders Railway</h2>
          <p>The Borders Railway opened in 2015. It’s the longest new line built, in the UK, for over a century, and takes passengers between Tweedbank and Edinburgh in less than an hour. Since opening, the line has had a significant economic and social impact on the area, with passenger numbers increasing each year through 4 million journeys. The Borders Railway is now attracting new workers, homeowners and tourists to communities served by the line.</p>
          <h2>Rail Stations</h2>
          <p>We are improving our major rail stations at Motherwell, Aberdeen, Inverness and Stirling and master planning with partners around others including Edinburgh Waverley.</p>
          <h2>Low Emission Zones</h2>
          <p>We are introducing Low Emission Zones in four cities – Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee – which will encourage investment in cleaner transport technologies.</p>

          <h2>Affordable Homes</h2>
          <p>We are spending over £3 billion to deliver at least 50,000 <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/more-homes/affordable-housing-supply/">affordable homes</a>, of which 35,000 will be for social rent, by March 2021. This investment, in partnership with councils, housing associations and developers, will leverage economic output in the region of £1.4 billion per year, supporting around 10,000 to 12,000 jobs per annum in the construction and related industries in Scotland.</p>
          <h2>Energy Efficiency</h2>
          <p>To improve the quality of our homes, we are investing £500m in energy efficiency over the lifetime of this Parliament. We will continue to ensure availability of the <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/more-homes/housing-infrastructure-fund/">Housing Infrastructure Fund</a> (HIF) across the country to support housing to come forward on strategic sites in both urban and rural areas through support for enabling infrastructure.</p>
          <h2>Rural Housing</h2>
          <p>We will continue to support the building of more houses in rural areas and following the pilot of a <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/self-build-loan-fund/">Self-Build Loan Fund</a> in the Highland Council Area, we will implement this initiative nationwide offering loans of up to £175,000.  Since January 2007 we have approved croft house grant payments of over £18 million assisting the building and improvement of over 900 croft houses helping to sustain rural communities and businesses.</p>
          <h2>Roadmap to 2040</h2>
          <p>We will now enable businesses within the housing supply system to better plan ahead by developing our roadmap to show how our homes and communities should look and feel in 2040. This encompasses the whole housing system and its contribution through creating communities that deliver better quality of life for people and communities, supporting repopulation in rural areas and boosting economic growth.</p>

          * **A [Route Map on an Energy Efficient Scotland](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/), that will lead to over £10 billion of activity to retrofit existing homes and buildings throughout all parts of Scotland**

          <hr>
          <h2>Energy Efficient Scotland Route Map</h2>
          <p>By 2030 the equivalent of 50% of the energy for Scotland’s heat, transport and electricity consumption is to be supplied from renewable sources, along with a 30% increase in the productivity of energy use across the Scottish economy. That is why we have made energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority and set out our plans for this transformation in the <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/">Energy Efficient Scotland Route Map</a>.  We estimate this will result in a £10-12 billion programme of public and private sector investment over the next 20 years, with the potential to boost Scottish GDP growth and generate economic opportunity across the whole of Scotland.</p>
          <h2>Funding the transition to a carbon neutral economy</h2>
          <p>We have already allocated around £40 million to 16 low carbon capital projects through the <a href="https://www.gov.scot/Topics/Business-Industry/Energy/Action/lowcarbon/LCITP">Low Carbon Infrastructure Transition Programme</a>. To progress our transition to a carbon neutral economy, we are providing support for renewable and local carbon infrastructure through our £20 million <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/renewable-and-low-carbon-energy/energy-investment-fund/">Energy Investment Fund</a> and £60 million Low Carbon Innovation Fund.</p>
          <h2>Wave and Tidal Energy</h2>
          <p>To maintain Scotland’s position as a world leader in wave and tidal energy technologies, our <a href="http://www.waveenergyscotland.co.uk/">Wave Energy Scotland</a> programme has been designed to drive forward the search for innovative solutions. The programme has already made £25 million available to support 60 innovative projects, maximising the economic benefit of design, manufacturing and export. Our flagship wave and tidal test facility, the <a href="http://www.emec.org.uk/">European Marine Energy Centre</a> (EMEC), has over a decade of real-sea experience. We will also continue to support the expansion of offshore wind by providing new guidance to industry on licensing and decommissioning, as well as providing a further £2 million this year to support innovation and to help reduce business costs.</p>
          <h2>Electricity and Gas Networks</h2>
          <p>Electricity and gas network businesses in Scotland, and their supply chain, will be key to realising our transition to a carbon neutral economy. We are working with these companies, as well as the wider sector and the regulator, to ensure these future plans are aligned to our vision for the sector.</p>

To progress our transition to a carbon neutral economy, we are providing support for renewable and local carbon infrastructure through our £20 million <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/renewable-and-low-carbon-energy/energy-investment-fund/">Energy Investment Fund</a> and £60 million Low Carbon Innovation Fund.</p>
          <h2>Wave and Tidal Energy</h2>
          <p>To maintain Scotland’s position as a world leader in wave and tidal energy technologies, our <a href="http://www.waveenergyscotland.co.uk/">Wave Energy Scotland</a> programme has been designed to drive forward the search for innovative solutions. The programme has already made £25 million available to support 60 innovative projects, maximising the economic benefit of design, manufacturing and export. Our flagship wave and tidal test facility, the <a href="http://www.emec.org.uk/">European Marine Energy Centre</a> (EMEC), has over a decade of real-sea experience. We will also continue to support the expansion of offshore wind by providing new guidance to industry on licensing and decommissioning, as well as providing a further £2 million this year to support innovation and to help reduce business costs.</p>
          <h2>Electricity and Gas Networks</h2>
          <p>Electricity and gas network businesses in Scotland, and their supply chain, will be key to realising our transition to a carbon neutral economy. We are working with these companies, as well as the wider sector and the regulator, to ensure these future plans are aligned to our vision for the sector.</p>

          * **A £20 million [Energy Investment Fund](https://beta.gov.scot/policies/renewable-and-low-carbon-energy/energy-investment-fund/)**
          * **A £60 million Low Carbon Innovation Fund**
          * **A [Route Map on an Energy Efficient Scotland](https://beta.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/), that will lead to over £10 billion of activity to retrofit existing homes and buildings throughout all parts of Scotland**
          * **50% of Scotland’s energy needs met by [renewables](https://www.sdi.co.uk/business-in-scotland/key-sectors/renewables) by 2030**
          * **£25m to support innovation in wave and tidal technologies**
          <hr>
          <h2>Energy Efficient Scotland Route Map</h2>
          <p>By 2030 the equivalent of 50% of the energy for Scotland’s heat, transport and electricity consumption is to be supplied from renewable sources, along with a 30% increase in the productivity of energy use across the Scottish economy. That is why we have made energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority and set out our plans for this transformation in the <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/">Energy Efficient Scotland Route Map</a>.  We estimate this will result in a £10-12 billion programme of public and private sector investment over the next 20 years, with the potential to boost Scottish GDP growth and generate economic opportunity across the whole of Scotland.</p>

          * **Investing £15 million to expand Scotland’s electric vehicle (EV) charging network**
          * **Invest in platforms to support testing and demonstration facilities**

          <h2>Ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEV)</h2>
          <p>We want Scotland to be at the forefront of growth in ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEV) markets, to ensure our business community and workforce benefit from the opportunities that new markets and technologies present.</p>
          <h2>Charging network</h2>
          <p>This year we are making available almost £50m to continue to support the take up of low emission vehicles and expand Scotland’s electric vehicle (EV) charging network (<a href="https://chargeplacescotland.org/">Charge Place Scotland</a>). This includes important initiatives such as the Electric A9 which will see us will work with our stakeholders to support new commercial opportunities while delivering benefits to consumers and integrating EVs into our electricity networks.</p>
          <p>In collaboration with our enterprise agencies, we will invest in emerging research and commercial opportunities, with a particular emphasis on testing and demonstration facilities and innovation at the interface between energy and mobility.</p>
          <p>In collaboration with the energy network operators, we will support opportunities for data-driven innovation to influence and manage consumer energy demand and to improve network management. To capitalise on Scotland’s internationally significant hydrogen projects and pilots, we will set in place a coordinated programme of work to upscale opportunities across emerging hydrogen transport markets.</p>
          <h2>Driverless cars</h2>
          <p>We will also continue to encourage and support ongoing research, development, demonstration, and deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) or driverless cars. For example, we are holding a two-day ‘CAV Scotland’ event taking place at the Royal Highland Centre on 30 October and 1 November this year (2018) and supporting a collaborative bid to InnovateUK’s ‘CAV4’ call for funding of an autonomous bus demonstrator. We are also partnering with INRIX on their ‘AV Road Rules’ platform to digitise part of the trunk road network and provide key data on road characteristics and encourage autonomous vehicle developers to bring trials and innovative technologies to Scotland.</p>

          <hr>
          <p>Scotland has been at the heart of the global oil and gas industry for decades, and remains a significant part of Scotland’s economy, worth an estimated £13.3 billion in 2017 and supporting an estimated 109,000 Scottish jobs, many of which are highly skilled.</p>
          <p>The sector has faced a challenging few years but industry reports are now showing a growth in investment with a further 5% increase forecast for production in 2018. We are also seeing an upturn in industry confidence. The North Sea still holds significant potential with up to 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent remaining, which could sustain product for the next 20 years.</p>
          <h2>Oil and Gas Technology Centre</h2>
          <p>We established the <a href="https://theogtc.com/">Oil &amp; Gas Technology Centre</a> (OGTC) in October 2016 with £180 million funding as part of the Aberdeen City Region Deal and are working in collaboration with other sectors to deploy new technology that could transform the sector.</p>
          <h2>Investment, innovation and diversification</h2>
          <p>We are building on these strengths by supporting investment, innovation and diversification across the sector. This includes working with industry on developing subsea-engineering, decommissioning, and carbon capture and storage. Decommissioning of oil and gas assets in the UK Continental Shelf could be worth around £60 billion over the coming decades, with a forecast spend of nearly £17 billion in the next 8 years alone, representing a huge opportunity for Scottish supply chain companies. We are enhancing Scotland’s decommissioning capability through the Decommissioning Challenge Fund, which has been extended with a further £5 million available in 2018/19 to the Scottish supply chain (in addition to the £4.8m awarded in 2017). We have also committed to investing in a deep water port capable of handling the largest structures for decommissioning and Dales Voe in Shetland has been identified as the optimal location for this facility.</p>
          <h2>Carbon Capture Utilisation &amp; Storage</h2>
          <p>We support Carbon Capture Utilisation &amp; Storage (CCUS) as an important decarbonisation infrastructure and industrial opportunity for Scotland. Scotland remains the best-placed country in Europe to realise CCUS on a commercial scale.</p>
