          <h2>Research and Development Expenditure</h2>
          <p>We have set an ambitious target of doubling Scotland’s business expenditure on research and development (R&amp;D) from £875m in 2015 to £1.7bn by 2025. To assist with this, we are providing over £110m in grant support for business R&amp;D over the next 3 years by increasing grant support for R&amp;D from £22m to £37m per annum. Significant progress is already being made – business expenditure on R&amp;D exceeded £1 billion for the first time in 2016.</p>
          <h2>Productivity Clubs</h2>
          <p>We recognise the importance of progressive business models, workplace innovation and Fair Work as central to our approach to creating value and business innovation. In partnership with SCDI, we will work with business to pilot two Productivity Clubs. The pilots – one urban, one largely rural – will support businesses who want to improve their own performance and share their advice and experiences to help others do the same. The Clubs will help support managerial capability and diffusion of innovation.</p>
          <h2>Can Do Business Innovation Forum</h2>
          <p>We will also now expand the role, remit and membership of the Can Do Business Innovation Forum to enable it to consider and take action on the economic and business opportunities and challenges of new and future technologies.</p>

          \ its turnover to £8 billion by 2025 by: increasing exports; creating the\
          \ right business environment to flourish; innovation; and the development\
          \ of new manufacturing facilities.</p>\n<p>The sector is at the cutting\

          \ such as digital manufacturing, automation, and research and development,\
          \ they have the right advice and support to help them make the next step.\

          \ Scottish Manufacturing Advisory Service (SMAS), with universities and\
          \ colleges and with other public and private sector partners to achieve\
          \ this.</p>\n<h2>Space Technologies</h2>\n<p>Scotland has strong industrial\

          <h2>NHS Scotland</h2>
          <p>We are committed to increasing the value of NHS collaborative innovation.  NHS Scotland invests £40 million a year to support research &amp; development and innovation. In 2017-18 this included support for 330 commercial clinical trials.  Further investment from 2018-19 will provide more effective support for health innovation, in part through the development of Test Beds to support health innovation partnerships between NHS Scotland and industry.</p>
          <h2>CivTech</h2>
          <p>We are improving people’s lives with better, faster and easier public service products through <a href="https://civtech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CIV/overview?mode=global">CivTech</a> and have delivered the first two CivTech cohorts, which have seen the participating companies to date win over £1.75m in contracts after the programme, create new jobs and secure equity investment. The next round of 11 challenges has elicited 129 applications from across the UK and the CivTech model is sparking interest across the world.</p>
          <h2>Procurement Innovation Partnerships</h2>
          <p>We will set up Procurement Innovation Partnerships to work collaboratively with public bodies to procure new goods and services to solve social challenges, creating opportunities for SMEs.</p>

          \ of academic research and vocational skills into business innovation**\
          \ \n* **Increasing our commitment to the value of research as a driver of\
          \ innovation and to academia-industry collaboration by investing a further\
          \ £17.6m in Scottish universities in 2018-19**\n<p>The global strength and\
          \ excellence of Scotland’s universities is reflected in our position within\
          \ the top quartile of OECD countries for higher education expenditure on\
          \ research and development as a percentage of GDP, as well as having four\
          \ universities in the world’s top 200 (Times Higher Education).  We want\
          \ to maintain that position and ensure this R&amp;D translates into practical\
          \ economic success.</p>\n<h2>Innovation Centres</h2>\n<p>We are working\
          \ collaboratively across the public sector by building on the £100 million\
          \ already invested in Scotland’s eight, university-hosted Innovation Centres.\
          \ These are having a transformational effect on our economy. Future funding\

          * **£300 million investment in data-driven innovation through the [Edinburgh and South East Scotland Region City Deal](http://www.acceleratinggrowth.org.uk/)**
          * **£1.5 million over 3 years to support the establishment of a UNICEF Data for Children Hub in Scotland in partnership with UNICEF, The Data Lab and the University of Edinburgh**
          * **£13.5m to support the next phase of The Data Lab Innovation Centre to cement Scotland’s position as a global data leader**
          <hr>
          <p>We are investing £300 million in the <a href="http://www.acceleratinggrowth.org.uk/">Edinburgh City Deal</a> which, with other partners will deliver an overall £1.3bn investment to unlock the region’s potential to become a global powerhouse in data-driven innovation.</p>
          <p>Our investment in The Data Lab and Censis will promote digitisation across our industries and help address the digital and data skills gap.</p>
          <h2>Digital Skills</h2>
          <p>Since 2014, we have provided <a href="https://www.skillsdevelopmentscotland.co.uk/">Skills Development Scotland</a> with £10.5 million to deliver a digital skills programme including support for <a href="https://codeclan.com/">CodeClan</a>, an industry-led digital skills academy in Edinburgh. Organisations like CodeClan are changing the fortunes of many.</p>
          <h2>Digital Growth Fund</h2>
          <p>Our £36 million Digital Growth Fund has kicked off with interest-free loans to businesses wanting to invest in digital equipment and skills. And we are supporting our Digital Boost programme to give advice and support that improves the level of digital maturity amongst businesses in every part of Scotland.</p>
          <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
          <p>The importance of, and global demand for, cyber security services and expertise will continue to grow exponentially. We are providing advice and support for workplace training on cyber security and financial support for smaller businesses and charities to put critical controls in place.</p>
          <p>We will provide seed funding of over £350,000 for a Cluster Management Organisation to support the growing number of businesses in this sector and £250,000 for a cyber resilience innovation call, to stimulate fresh thinking in our private sector and help meet the future challenges our public sector will face.</p>
          <p>Additionally, we will support the development of a skilled cyber resilience workforce, through defined learning pathways into cyber security careers (including for career changers) and support for children and young people to develop key cyber skills.</p>
          <p>We are also embarking on a programme of work to capture the economic opportunities of the Internet of Things for all sectors of our economy.</p>

          **A more circular economy will benefit:**
          <ul>
          <li><strong>The environment by cutting waste and carbon emissions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The economy by improving productivity and opening up new markets</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Communities by providing new local employment opportunities and lower cost options to access the goods we need</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <p>A circular economy fosters innovation and encourages the development of business models which re-use products and materials and create value where before there was waste. <a href="https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk">Zero Waste Scotland</a> are encouraging the development of innovative new circular economic business models such as that developed by Moock Environmental that can potentially be used in high value industries and turn a waste product into an economic opportunity. We want Scotland to be involved in driving circular economy opportunities across all sectors of the economy.</p>
          <h2>Deposit Return Scheme</h2>
          <p>We are taking action as a Government to enhance recycling, including designing a deposit return scheme which will deliver a step change in our recycling rate, prevent littering and create new opportunities within the Scottish economy. This will create an economic opportunity for both the reprocessing of material and its subsequent reuse by companies keen to respond to consumer interest in more recycled content.</p>
          <h2>Just Transition Commission</h2>
          <p>We are also establishing a Just Transition Commission to advise Scottish Ministers on adjusting to a more sustainable and resource-efficient economic model in a fair way which will help to tackle inequality and poverty, and promote a fair and inclusive jobs market.</p>

          **A more circular economy will benefit:**
          <ul>
          <li><strong>The environment by cutting waste and carbon emissions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The economy by improving productivity and opening up new markets</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Communities by providing new local employment opportunities and lower cost options to access the goods we need</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          <p>A circular economy fosters innovation and encourages the development of business models which re-use products and materials and create value where before there was waste. <a href="https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk">Zero Waste Scotland</a> are encouraging the development of innovative new circular economic business models such as that developed by Moock Environmental that can potentially be used in high value industries and turn a waste product into an economic opportunity. We want Scotland to be involved in driving circular economy opportunities across all sectors of the economy.</p>
          <h2>Deposit Return Scheme</h2>
          <p>We are taking action as a Government to enhance recycling, including designing a deposit return scheme which will deliver a step change in our recycling rate, prevent littering and create new opportunities within the Scottish economy. This will create an economic opportunity for both the reprocessing of material and its subsequent reuse by companies keen to respond to consumer interest in more recycled content.</p>
          <h2>Just Transition Commission</h2>
          <p>We are also establishing a Just Transition Commission to advise Scottish Ministers on adjusting to a more sustainable and resource-efficient economic model in a fair way which will help to tackle inequality and poverty, and promote a fair and inclusive jobs market.</p>
          <h2>Key resources:</h2>

          * **The Scottish Government and Scotland’s business, academic and public sector partners value the relationships we have with our European partners forging research and innovation collaborations that can have a global impact**

          <p>Collaboration and sharing of good practice with EU partners has been a cornerstone of our ability to tackle shared challenges from the domestic to the global e.g. tackling organised crime that does not respect boundaries, action on climate change and space exploration to name a few. Through our European Networks we can target business, public sector and academic leadership in areas in major economic opportunity for Scotland. Working in partnership will allow us to accelerate the development of new innovative approaches in Scotland; show leadership in emerging business and sectoral opportunities and enhance our standing on the world stage.</p>
          <h2>European Networks</h2>
          <p>We recognise the benefits of active collaboration of academia, business and the public sector in European research and innovation activity: through shared access to European networks; mobility and career development opportunities for researchers, building reputational opportunities for science and business, and being part of pan-European collaborations with the benefits that projects of these size and scale offer to all participants including to leverage the collaborations as points of external investment.</p>
          <p>We are also committed to a strong and collaborative relationship with our European partners. Our ambition is to ensuring a right to future Scottish participation and involvement in EU programmes such as Horizon Europe which allow Scottish businesses and universities to collaborate and drive innovation.</p>
