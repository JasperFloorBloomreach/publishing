          * **£20 million in our new plan _‘A trading nation: our plan for growing Scotland’s exports’_**
          * **Increase the involvement of private sector expertise, facilitating peer-to-peer networking and learning to grow our exports and imports**
          * **A new Food and Drink 5-Year Export Plan**
          <hr>
          <h2>A trading nation: our plan for growing Scotland’s exports</h2>
          <p>To improve the ability of Scotland’s businesses to export we will build on the recommendations of the Enterprise and Skills Strategic Board to set out a range of detailed actions in <em>A trading nation: our plan for growing Scotland’s exports</em> by Spring 2019.  We will support our new plan with over £20 million investment in the next three years. As part of that work we will:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Invest £2 million over three years to intensively support 50 high export growth businesses per year to ramp up overseas ambitions and activity.</li>
          <li>Create 100 new business-to-business peer mentorships per year for new exporters.</li>
          <li>Expand the network of in-market sector specialists working in overseas markets to identify untapped potential and connect Scottish business to exploit this.</li>
          <li>Increase Export Finance support for Scottish companies looking to enter new markets.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Trade Board and Envoys</h2>
          <p>We have established a <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/groups/ministerial-trade-board/">Trade Board</a> and a network of Trade Envoys to champion Scottish businesses and exports abroad, and will ask these talented Scots to help Scottish businesses grow exports and imports. We have launched the Brexit Readiness toolkit for businesses and specifically for exporters to help them plan their way through the uncertainty and minimise the impact.</p>
          <h2>Food and Drink 5-Year Export Plan</h2>
          <p>To support trade in Scotland’s outstanding produce, we will publish a new Food and Drink 5-Year Export Plan and bring forward new measures to promote and market our produce in overseas markets. We will also increase the number of Scottish products with Protected Geographic Indication.</p>

          <h2>Scotland is Now</h2>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.scotland.org">Scotland Is Now</a> campaign is promoting Scotland as an open and outward-looking country and is already raising Scotland’s profile on the international stage. Building on this we will work with business and other stakeholders to develop one clear national Scotland brand for all to use. We will underpin this with open-source promotional material to support our businesses to go global and to attract global businesses to come to Scotland.</p>
          <h2>International network</h2>
          <p>We have added to our existing international network with new offices in Dublin, London and Berlin, to promote Scotland as a place to live, work, invest and do business, as well as almost doubling the number of staff working for <a href="https://www.sdi.co.uk/">Scottish Development International</a> (SDI) across Europe to support Scottish businesses. The Scottish Government, SDI and VisitScotland collectively already have a permanent presence in more than 30 locations in 19 countries, with further openings in Paris and Ottawa in 2019. This presence provides direct market intelligence and connections for Scotland’s businesses. We will use this presence to increase ministerial visibility in existing and potential trading partner countries, developing stronger government-to-government and business-to-government networks.</p>
          <h2>GlobalScots</h2>
          <p>We will revamp <a href="https://www.globalscot.com/">GlobalScot</a> and engage Scotland’s wider network of diaspora, alumni and friends globally, to help better understand and exploit specific opportunities across global markets.</p>

          <h2>Scotland is Now</h2>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.scotland.org">Scotland Is Now</a> campaign is promoting Scotland as an open and outward-looking country and is already raising Scotland’s profile on the international stage. Building on this we will work with business and other stakeholders to develop one clear national Scotland brand for all to use. We will underpin this with open-source promotional material to support our businesses to go global and to attract global businesses to come to Scotland.</p>
          <h2>International network</h2>
          <p>We have added to our existing international network with new offices in Dublin, London and Berlin, to promote Scotland as a place to live, work, invest and do business, as well as almost doubling the number of staff working for <a href="https://www.sdi.co.uk/">Scottish Development International</a> (SDI) across Europe to support Scottish businesses. The Scottish Government, SDI and VisitScotland collectively already have a permanent presence in more than 30 locations in 19 countries, with further openings in Paris and Ottawa in 2019. This presence provides direct market intelligence and connections for Scotland’s businesses. We will use this presence to increase ministerial visibility in existing and potential trading partner countries, developing stronger government-to-government and business-to-government networks.</p>
          <h2>GlobalScots</h2>
          <p>We will revamp <a href="https://www.globalscot.com/">GlobalScot</a> and engage Scotland’s wider network of diaspora, alumni and friends globally, to help better understand and exploit specific opportunities across global markets.</p>

          * **Push the UK Government to recognise the action that is needed to protect Scotland’s prosperity and wellbeing**
          * **Build on the success of the ‘[We are Scotland](https://onescotland.org/campaigns/we-are-scotland/)’ social media campaign**
          * **Bring forward an Electoral Franchise Bill**
          * **Launch a ‘Come to Scotland’ campaign to attract talent and investment**
          <hr>
          <p>To attract talent to Scotland and grow our population (including as part of the repopulation of our rural areas) we need a migration system which reflects Scotland’s distinct needs. The recent report from the Migration Advisory Committee confirmed evidence from the Scottish Government about the positive impact of EEA nationals to our economy, our public services and our communities.</p>
          <p>We will continue to push the UK Government to recognise the action that is needed to protect Scotland’s prosperity and wellbeing. Scottish Ministers should have the powers to tailor migration policy, within a UK framework to meet Scotland’s distinct needs.</p>
          <h2>'Come to Scotland' campaign</h2>
          <p>We will now build on the success of the ‘<a href="https://onescotland.org/campaigns/we-are-scotland/">We are Scotland</a>’ social media campaign to launch a ‘Come to Scotland’ campaign to attract talent and investment.</p>
          <p>In addition, we will bring forward an Electoral Franchise Bill to give fair access to voting rights for all those who have a legal right to live in Scotland. EU students already studying here, starting a degree in the autumn this year or next year (2019) will continue to be eligible to receive free tuition.</p>

          * **Our national tourism organisation VisitScotland has a budget of more than £45 million a year**

          <hr>
          <p>Tourism makes a significant contribution to Scotland’s economy and international image. It is a significant employer in both rural and urban areas, making it important for our Inclusive Growth agenda.</p>
          <p>We are delivering support for the four priorities set out in the industry-led <a href="http://scottishtourismalliance.co.uk/page/national-strategy/">Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA) “Tourism Scotland 2020” strategy</a>, and sponsor Scotland’s national tourism organisation, VisitScotland, with a budget of more than £45 million a year.</p>
          <h2>Sport</h2>
          <p>The Scottish Government was the principal funder of the highly successful Glasgow 2018 European Championships. We will now play host to the European Indoor Athletic Championships and the European Short Course Swimming Championships.  The Scottish Government’s investment has also enabled Scotland to host the 2019 Solheim Cup at Gleneagles, the world’s biggest event in women’s golf.</p>
          <h2>Rural Tourism</h2>
          <p>Through our mandatory Rural Rates Relief scheme and our small Business Bonus Scheme, we have helped a number of small rural hotels to cope with increasing business costs. We stablished the £6 million Rural Tourism Infrastructure Fund to provide investment in infrastructure to support sustainable growth in rural tourism across Scotland.</p>
          <p>We are working with partners to promote the South of Scotland as a visitor destination. We also supported destination development projects and organisations with in excess of £1m funding through Scottish Enterprise’s destination fund in 2018-19. This is alongside more than £3 million destination development support for Scotland’s biggest cities. We are providing £15m capital investment through the Inverness and Region City Deal to enable Inverness Castle to be turned into a visitor attraction of national importance by 2021 for the economic benefit of the city and the wider Highlands.</p>
          <h2>Northern Innovation Hub</h2>
          <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) will also use the Northern Innovation Hub (£11.5m) part of the Inverness and Region city deal to help develop the Highlands for adventure tourism, and encourage more tourism businesses to engage in international trade.  Digital city deal money (with HIE support) will be used for business development, skills and wi-fi open access.</p>
          <p>Along with our visitor economy agencies, we have continued to support Digital Tourism Scotland – a £1.2 million, 3 year public and private sector partnership project running until 2019 across Scotland, which will improve the digital skills and capabilities of tourism businesses.</p>

          <h2><em>case study:</em>{:.hidden} Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust, Dumfries</h2>
          <p>Driven by forward by a group of volunteer trustees, The Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust was established in 2009 as a company limited by guarantee with charitable status. Moat Brae will become Scotland’s first Centre for Children’s Literature and Storytelling, as well as a major international visitor attraction, that celebrates the literary, cultural and historical connections that the house and garden at Moat Brae have with J M Barrie and his world famous character Peter Pan. The Centre will open its doors in spring 2019 and provide (i) specialist interpretation to inspire visitors (estimated 45,000 per year) with the history and heritage of Moat Brae; (ii) interactive rooms to fuel the imagination, help visitors develop their creative potential and host a programme of public activities related to children’s literature and storytelling; (iii) a fully accessible activity trail, inspired by a Neverland Discovery Garden that connects plants and people; (iv) an education suite for large school or literature groups in a dedicated contemporary learning extension; (v) a café and shop for children’s books, toys and merchandise; and (vi) offices for Peter Pan Moat Brae Trust staff and volunteers.</p>
          <p>The £8m project has been jointly funded by Scottish Enterprise, Heritage Lottery Fund, Creative Scotland, Historic Environment Scotland, Dumfries &amp; Galloway Council, Scottish Government as well as a number of private Trusts, Foundations and individuals.</p>
          <p>The Dumfries &amp; Galloway economy is characterised by a low GVA, a declining and ageing population, a low wage economy, a high rate of unemployment and a high dependency on the public sector for employment. The town of Dumfries is the largest town in the region with a population of 30,000 – and has 3 datazones which are amongst the 15% most deprived areas in Scotland. This project reflects multi-agency working, bringing together regeneration and economic activity as well as creating 32.5 new FTEs, the project seeks to help create a vibrant and creative capital town in Dumfries &amp; Galloway.  This exciting and innovative project has the potential to make a very real difference to the economic regeneration of south-west Scotland.</p>
