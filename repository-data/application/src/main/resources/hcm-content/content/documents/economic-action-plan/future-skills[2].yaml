          <p>The Strategic Plan of the Enterprise and Skills Strategic Board is a vision for the future with a 20 year horizon. Its ambition is that the whole enterprise and skills system drives sustainable and inclusive economic growth.</p>
          <p>A key pillar of the Plan is its mission to improve future skills provision in Scotland, working towards a skills system that is more agile, responsive and flexible, and better matches the needs of both industry and learners, now and in the future.</p>
          <p>The Board is keen to drive a culture of lifelong learning at all stages of an individual’s career, including a stronger emphasis on work-based learning and supporting individuals to upskill and reskill. It is vital that Scotland's Future Skills Action plan builds on wider activity in the Future Skills Mission including defining meta-skills and implementing skills alignment.</p>
          <p>I therefore warmly welcome the Scottish Government’s publication of Scotland's Future Skills Action Plan’s first phase and its common ambition for a skills system that can respond to the challenges and opportunities ahead. Its endorsement of the Strategic Board’s recommendations underlines the increasingly shared vision and ambition for Scotland’s skills system, and it is greatly encouraging that the plan has come about through close collaboration between the Scottish Government, Skills Development Scotland and the Scottish Funding Council.</p>
          <p>The Plan represents an initial response to a long term and ambitious agenda, so I am delighted that Scottish Government has accepted our proposals and that we will be a partner in delivering the change required.</p>
          <p>That growing culture of collaboration will be essential to fulfilling our shared goals. Promoting workplace innovation, effective leadership and a strong worker voice will also be vital in achieving lasting and sustainable change.</p>
          <p>I look forward to continuing to work with the Scottish Government, its agencies and all of those who are engaged in and contribute to Scotland’s skills system as Scotland's Future Skills Action Plan is delivered in the years ahead.’</p>

          <p><em>Scotland’s highly skilled workforce ensures we are an ambitious, productive and competitive nation. Scotland’s skills system will be the foundation on which we will deliver these ambitions, supporting our people through-out their working lives, and empowering our business to take advantage of future opportunities. A culture of shared investment in Scotland’s future workforce will unlock the potential of our people and businesses and deliver inclusive growth.</em></p>
          <p>Scotland’s Enterprise and Skills Strategic Board set out <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/working-collaboratively-better-scotland/">four key future skills recommendations</a> for Government in its 2018 Strategic Plan. That plan recognised the crucial role of the skills system in ensuring equality, wellbeing and sustainability.</p>
          <p>The publication of Phase 1 of Scotland's Future Skills Action Plan fulfils our commitment to respond to those recommendations, which we endorse in full.  It also reaffirms the importance of skills in helping people reach their potential and achieving our goal of an inclusive, growing and more productive economy.</p>
          <p>Across four themes the Plan highlights the vital role the skills system will play in helping Scotland to respond to future socio-economic challenges, such as demographic changes and the climate emergency.</p>
          <p>The four themes in our plan are:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Increasing system agility and employer responsiveness;</li>
          <li>Enhancing access to upskilling and retraining opportunities;</li>
          <li>Ensuring sustainability across the skill system; and</li>
          <li>Accelerating the implementation of the learner journey review.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The Plan begins by outlining why skills are so important for Scotland. It then set out how the Scottish Government is currently working to meet the Strategic Board’s recommendations.</p>
          <p>Key actions include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>Increasing our investment in workforce development to £20m per annum from 20/21, building on the current £10m Flexible Workforce Development Fund.</li>
          <li>Addressing skills gaps and shortages as a central part of the Scottish Government’s response to the UK’s departure from the European Union.</li>
          <li>The National Manufacturing Institute Scotland (NMIS) Manufacturing Skills Academy’s development of a catalogue of advanced manufacturing modules, which cater to and recognise a range of industry needs across the sector.</li>
          <li>Skills Development Scotland, the Scottish Qualifications Authority and the Scottish Funding Council will develop and promote a clear definition of meta-skills, the timeless, higher-order skills that create adaptive learners, and fully implement the joint 5 stage skills alignment planning model.</li>
          <li>Continuing to support industry-led Developing the Young Workforce Employer Groups.</li>
          <li>Identifying opportunities to enhance access to upskilling and reskilling opportunities through the Scottish National Retraining Partnership in conjunction with the CBI and STUC.</li>
          <li>As part of the £1.3 billion funding made available to City and Growth Deals, building on work to develop and deliver skills investment plans in each region.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We also outline our proposals to take the Plan’s second phase forward. In particular, we will establish a thematic approach to our work with stakeholders from across the skills system to identify and co-create the specific solutions required to deliver this plan in the medium to long terms.</p>
          <p>Finally, the Plan summarises the findings set out in <a href="https://www.gov.scot/isbn/9781839601057/">Scotland’s Future Skills Action Plan – Evidence and Analysis Annex</a> which we have published providing more detail on Scotland’s strengths and weaknesses; and the long-term and emerging challenges facing the labour market.</p>
          <p>Meeting Scotland’s skills challenges cannot be met by Government alone, and will require collective action from across society and the economy. The publication of Scotland's Future Skills Action Plan’s first phase is a step towards achieving this goal.</p>

          <p>Finally, the Plan summarises the findings set out in <a href="https://www.gov.scot/isbn/9781839601057/">Scotland’s Future Skills Action Plan – Evidence and Analysis Annex</a> which we have published providing more detail on Scotland’s strengths and weaknesses; and the long-term and emerging challenges facing the labour market.</p>
          <p>Meeting Scotland’s skills challenges cannot be met by Government alone, and will require collective action from across society and the economy. The publication of Scotland's Future Skills Action Plan’s first phase is a step towards achieving this goal.</p>

          <p>Scotland's Future Skills Action Plan fully endorses the recommendations made by the Enterprise and Skills Strategic Board’s <em>Future Skills Mission</em> as described in their 2018 Strategic Plan.</p>
          <p>We are committed to working jointly with both Skills Development Scotland, the Scottish Funding Council and wider partners to coherently deliver on both the actions and recommendations of the Future Skills Mission.</p>
          <p>They are:</p>
          <h3>Actions</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>
          <p>Fully implement the joint 5 stage skills alignment planning model, aligning provision with industry needs and critical skills as set out in the demand evidence. SFC and SDS will collaborate further to create a seamless, one system approach for learners, employers and the economy.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Define the ‘meta skills’ required to thrive in the future economy as the basis for future skills provision.</p>
          </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Recommendations</h3>
          <ul>
          <li>
          <p>Use funding for colleges, universities and training providers to provide more agile support for workers and employers to upskill and reskill, increasing provision of in-work learning. The Scottish Funding Council (SFC) and Skills Development Scotland (SDS) will jointly plan and deliver new models of provision.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Transform our skills system by integrating and expanding existing upskilling and reskilling interventions. This should be aligned with the work of the new National Retraining Partnership and aligned with consideration of a redesign of existing initiatives such as the Individual Training Account and the Flexible Workforce Development Fund.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Create a flexible and sustainable funding model to meet the future expansion of demand for both work-based and work-integrated learning (e.g. qualifications and training augmented with work placements or live business projects). SFC and SDS should work together to ensure there is a flexible, and sustainable funding model for all such pathways, in advance of the withdrawal of EU structural funds.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
          <p>Accelerate implementation, and set a timescale for delivery of the Learner Journey Review recommendations, in particular where these reduce duplication and accelerate the pace that people can proceed through the school, college, university and apprenticeship systems, creating more effective pathways to productive employment. SFC and SDS should jointly draft advice to Government on the Learner Journey, including consideration of aligning existing funds.</p>

          <p>Improving productivity, inclusive growth, and fair work are critical for Scotland’s future success, and skills play a key role in each. From seizing emerging economic opportunities and supporting those in low-paid work, to stimulating development and progression, skills and training can help deliver sustainable and inclusive economic growth for all.</p>
          <p>The overarching themes set out in this Plan and the Strategic Board’s recommendations have helped to shape our vision for Scotland’s skills system. This provides a focal point for our development of skills policies and programmes in the years ahead:</p>
          <p><em>Scotland’s highly skilled workforce ensures we are an ambitious, productive and competitive nation. Scotland’s skills system will be the foundation on which we will deliver these ambitions, supporting our people through-out their working lives, and empowering our business to take advantage of future opportunities. A culture of shared investment in Scotland’s future workforce will unlock the potential of our people and businesses and deliver inclusive growth.</em></p>
          <h3>How we are meeting future skills challenges</h3>
          <p>Skills are vital to achieving our ambitions of becoming a Fair Work nation. They are essential in helping individuals to prosper and maximise their potential, for businesses to grow and thrive and to entrench dignity and opportunity in the workplace.</p>
          <p>The Strategic Board’s recommendations act as themes for change across the skills system and against which we can implement, measure and report success.</p>
          <p>We recognise that delivering our vision for the skills system can only be achieved by working in partnership with employers. It is vital that employers are active in the design, investment and development of workforce planning and we will include them as we further develop the Plan.

          <p>Scotland’s skills system needs to be flexible, agile and responsive. These attributes will enable it to continue delivering strong results in an uncertain future, and continue to support Scotland’s workforce and employers.</p>
          <p>To meet future skills challenges, workers should be able to access upskilling, retraining and learning opportunities that meet their needs and circumstances.</p>
          <p>At the same time, the skills system must understand and reflect employer needs so that it is able to respond most effectively, with the right interventions, supporting individual organisations and Scotland’s economy as a whole.</p>
          <p>We believe it is critical that work based learning, greater access to learning which is both modular and provides opportunity for practical experience in the work place should be delivered in conjunction with employers across Scotland.</p>
          <h3>Next steps</h3>
          <p>1.1) With Skills Development Scotland, the Scottish Qualifications Authority and the Scottish Funding Council; we will develop and promote a clear definition of <a href="https://www.skillsdevelopmentscotland.co.uk/media/44684/skills-40_a-skills-model.pdf">meta-skills</a>, and begin to embed them within the education and skills system and in support for our future workforce.</p>
          <p>1.2) Addressing skills gaps and shortages will be a central part of the Scottish Government’s economic and labour market response to the UK’s departure from the European Union.</p>
          <p>1.3) We are developing a distinct Scottish approach to retaining and attracting talent to address skills gaps and labour market shortages. This will include working collaboratively with Skills Development Scotland, our enterprise agencies, local government and employers to attract people with the right skills, to the right parts of Scotland, taking account of the specific challenges to rural and island communities. This will form part of the Scottish Government’s response to the population challenge which is being led by the Ministerial Task Force on Population.</p>
          <p>1.4) Working with Skills Development Scotland, the Scottish Funding Council and industry partners we will enhance the delivery of Graduate Apprenticeships available in critical subjects such as civil engineering, digital and cyber security and data science. Alongside this we will engage with business on <a href="https://consult.gov.scot/employability-and-training/apprenticeship-levy/results/scottish-government-response-to-the-uk-government-apprenticeship-levy----.pdf">the Scottish Government’s ongoing response to the UK Government Apprenticeship Levy</a>.</p>
          <p>1.5) With Skills Development Scotland, we will publish  a Climate Emergency Skills Action Plan; providing the framework for the skills investment needed to meet the global climate change challenge and successfully support Scotland’s transition to a low carbon economy in a just and inclusive manner.</p>
          <p>This framework will:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>maximise the opportunities for people to upskill and reskill within the energy system, moving into areas such as oil and gas decommissioning, offshore wind energy and energy systems management</li>
          <li>give people the skills needed to support the changes in the energy efficiencies of our buildings and manufacturing and the decarbonisation of our transport system</li>
          <li>create a supportive and collaborative business environment for research and innovation in new low carbon industries so that we can be ahead of the game and able to prepare for the new skills that will be needed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>1.6) To make sure that they can get the right information, advice and support at the right time, by the end of 2019, businesses will be able to access products and services from our enterprise and skills agencies as well as Business Gateway through the online single entry point currently being developed with businesses.</p>
          <p>1.7) As part of our drive to ensure businesses can make the most of technology, we will work with industry, education and skills providers to develop appropriate ecommerce training to support companies to scale up. This will include our enterprise and skills agencies, Skills Development Scotland and Scottish Enterprise, providing support for a pilot programme which will test approaches to ecommerce skills development.</p>

          <p>As identified by the Strategic Plan of the Enterprise and Skills Strategic Board, the accelerated implementation of the recommendations of the Learner Journey Review presents an opportunity to enhance the experience of 15-24 year olds in Scotland’s education system. This is critical to safeguard Scotland’s long-term economic prosperity.</p>
          <p>The implementation of these recommendations is a Scottish Government priority. Given the clear parallels between the Learner Journey Review, Developing the Young Workforce (DYW), and this plan, there is a strong opportunity to enhance each other’s delivery, working collaboratively in mutual benefit and support.</p>
          <h3>Next steps</h3>
          <p>4.1) We are embedding work-based learning as an integral part of the offer available to learners, fully integrating foundation and graduate apprenticeships into the education and skills system.</p>
          <p>4.2) We will enhance pathways from the College sector into Graduate Apprenticeships.</p>
          <p>4.3) We will strengthen community-based adult learning provision, promoting greater collaboration between colleges and local authorities to create clear pathways for retraining and upskilling for all.</p>
          <p>4.4) We will reinforce the important role that employers play by committing to support the DYW employer group infrastructure for at least a further 4 years.</p>
          <p>We will work with the DYW employer groups and others to review their the priorities and ensure that they can contribute to achieving the Scottish Government’s vision to build sustainable and inclusive economic growth and tackle child poverty by focussing on opportunities for young people most likely to be left behind.</p>
          <p>4.5) We will accelerate coordination of the curriculum offer; better incentivise progression through school, further and higher education – and ensure all journeys are purposeful leading to the best outcomes for both learners and employers.</p>

          <p>There is much to celebrate in Scotland’s skills system, both in terms of its existing success and how it is already responding to the ambitions of Scotland’s Future Skills Action Plan. These are strong foundations to build upon.  As we develop the Plan we will seek to develop appropriate labour market information to enhance our understanding of its strengths and weaknesses, and to more accurately assess our progress.</p>
          <h3>Creating the environment to deliver Scotland’s future skills</h3>
          <p>We must create a culture of collective investment in Scotland’s workforce. This can be achieved through our public investment in the skills system, and the investment employers make in their employees. We can unlock this potential by ensuring close alignment of the next phase of the Scotland’s Future Skills Action Plan with delivery of the Strategic Boards’ Strategic Plan, including the Business Models and Workplace Innovations mission.</p>
          <p>This will allow us to fully explore how we create more capacity for leadership and management within our businesses to develop the skills of their, and Scotland’s, future workforce.</p>
          <p>In line with our ambitions around Fair Work and the Fair Work Convention’s principles, we will ensure the views and needs of workers are recognised. This includes their experience of both in-work training and engagement with the skills system, to inform upskilling and retraining opportunities.</p>
          <p>We recognise the importance of a future workforce which has the ability to be increasingly agile and successful in the labour market. We will ensure that our future skills programmes provide individuals with accredited learning and qualifications that support successful transition in the labour market.</p>
          <p>Equipping our young people with the skills required to fulfil their potential remain a key priority, and we re-affirm our long term commitment to Developing Scotland’s Young Workforce, and the important role it will continue to play in creating Scotland’s workforce in future.</p>
          <p>As our skills system evolves to meet Scotland’s future skills needs, its ability to demonstrate a clear contribution to the Scottish Government’s strategic outcomes will be central to our ambitions for the system.</p>
          <p>We will ensure collaboration and aligned delivery across all elements of the skills system, to ensure they support our ambitions to improve Scotland’s productivity, equality, wellbeing and sustainability.</p>
          <h3>Who will be involved</h3>
          <p>The development of the second phase of Scotland’s Future Skills Action Plan will have stakeholder engagement at its core, to ensure we critically assess and develop the policies and solutions required to deliver Scotland’s future skills.</p>
          <p>Understanding employer, worker and learner experience of our current system will be crucial, as will their ability to articulate which skills they – and the wider economy - may require in the years to come. Similarly, we will engage with universities, colleges and others offering education and training, to identify new areas for collaboration and establish how the skills system can deliver the Plan’s ambitions.</p>
          <p>We will also engage with learners and workers to understand the pathways and types of training that can support their participation and progression in the labour market.</p>
          <p>Our agencies will remain critical partners, particularly in regard to long-term labour market planning, improving skills alignment and placing meta-skills at the heart of the skills system.</p>

          <p>It is important to recognise that Scotland benefits from a strong, highly-developed skills system. Its cornerstones include:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>High-quality training and skills development leading to standardised and robust qualifications;</li>
          <li>Recognising the importance of work-based learning;</li>
          <li>Strong institutions providing education at a primary, secondary and tertiary level;</li>
          <li>An increasing parity of esteem for vocational and academic learning;</li>
          <li>A diverse spectrum of delivery models, tailored to individual learner need, and;</li>
          <li>Employer engagement throughout the skills system, providing opportunities to ensure education and training deliver the skills that businesses need and support people into fulfilling work.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Scotland’s schools, colleges and universities play a central role in helping learners of all ages to develop their skills.</p>
          <p>From age 3 to 18, Scotland’s education system, through  Curriculum for Excellence, supports young people to experience opportunities that develop their skills for learning, work and life, both within specific curricular areas and in general.</p>
          <p>Our youth employment strategy - Developing the Young Workforce - is expanding and embedding work ready skills by providing work-based opportunities for all of Scotland’s young people. Foundation apprenticeships form a valuable work-based learning pathway and a strong foundation upon which permanent and productive links between education and the wider economy may be developed.</p>
          <p>This feeds into Scotland’s college and university sectors, which provide world class tertiary education opportunities and support  Scotland’s growing apprenticeship offer with Modern and Graduate apprenticeships enabling apprentices to learn and earn with clear pathways into permanent employment.</p>
          <p>Our ambition for Scotland’s skills system is complemented by a range of policies, plans and strategies relating to the provision of education in schools, colleges and universities, including: Developing the Young Workforce and the STEM Education and Training Strategy.</p>
          <p>Employers are vital partners at all levels of Scotland’s education and skills systems. Scotland’s apprenticeship programme is perhaps the foremost manifestation of this as apprenticeships are delivered in concert with businesses.</p>
          <p>However, cooperation extends far beyond this, encompassing secondary and tertiary education, oversight from professional bodies and critically, in-work training and upskilling opportunities. The latter is growing in importance and we need to encourage more companies to plan for their employees’ future skills needs and ensure that staff can access opportunities to improve their skillset. Doing so is not only essential to enhance business dynamism and growth, but also for Scotland’s future prosperity.</p>

          <p>Although educational access and attainment have improved, skills gaps have increased due to a tightening labour supply. The 2017 Employer Skills Survey (ESS) revealed that 16% of Scottish employers reported skills gaps and estimated that 5% of the workforce lacks full proficiency: largely unchanged since 2015. Among those organisations that reported skills shortages, both technical and personal skills were cited in the ESS. For example, 59% suggested that specialist skills were needed, while 46% suggested that the ability to manage and prioritise were required.</p>
          <p>Skills gaps vary across sectors with a reported high of 7.2% in manufacturing and low of 2.3% in IT and communications. Between 2015 and 2017 skills gaps fluctuated greatly. For example, in education they fell from 5.3% to 3.5%, while they rose from 4.3% to 5.0% in construction and remained static (5.2%) in business services.</p>
          <p>Alongside skills gaps, the ESS survey revealed that over a third of employers (35%) in 2017 reported having at least one member of staff with qualifications and skills of a higher level than their role required, an increase from 32% in 2015.</p>

          <h3>Quality of Work</h3>
          <p>Despite strong headline labour market results, there are signs of fragility around the quality of work in our labour market. The proportion of Scotland’s workforce in full time work in 2018 remains below the pre-recession rate and has declined over the past 2 years[^2].</p>
          <p>And although the past decade has seen strong growth in roles defined as medium to high skill level[^3], analysis by the OECD concludes that employment growth in the UK between 2010-2017 was driven by sectors with below average productivity and wages[^4].</p>
          <p>A prolonged period of slow wage growth is reflected in the latest poverty data. Data for 2015-18, showed 60% of working-age adults in Scotland living in relative poverty after housing costs lived in working households - the highest on record.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is already acting to mitigate these challenges through our progressive Fair Work agenda, including the real Living Wage, and the Scottish Business Pledge. An initial assessment, published in the Tackling Child Poverty Progress Report, suggests that the Scottish Government invested over £1.4 billion in 2018-19 to support low income households. This includes the £100 million we invest each year to mitigate the worst impacts of UK Government welfare reforms.”</p>
          <p>This plan will build on these commitments and support our goal of delivering good work through employment that is fulfilling, secure and well-paid.</p>
          <h3>Demographics</h3>
          <p>Scotland’s population growth has traditionally been slower than the UK as a whole, and this is expected to continue. National Records Scotland’s projections for 2016 – 2041 suggest that driven by relatively low birth rates and inward net migration, Scotland’s working age population is only expected to grow by 1% compared with 8% in the UK[^5].</p>
          <p>Although migration to Scotland has to date eased some of the pressures resulting from an ageing population, this slowed over the year to 2018 – ending a period of growth since the EU expansion in 2004<a href="[https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/migration/migration-statistics/migration-flows](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/migration/migration-statistics/migration-flows/)">^6</a>.</p>
          <p>Our ageing population presents challenges to labour supply and as the average age of our workforce increases, it is likely that the need to provide retraining and upskilling opportunities for older workers will rise substantially.</p>
          <h3>Inequalities</h3>
          <p>We must ensure that individuals across Scotland can maximise their potential and make a positive contribution to Scotland’s future. That means supporting a more inclusive and diverse workforce with participation and progression in the labour market for all regardless of gender, age, race or disability. In Scotland there are persistent differences in employment and pay by gender, race and disability status.</p>
          <p>In 2018, the gap between the employment rates of men and women was 7.7 percentage points, between disabled and non-disabled people it was 35.5 percentage points., and between white people and people from minority ethnic groups, it was 19.7 percentage points<a href="[https://www.gov.scot/publications/regional-employment-patterns-scotland-statistics-annual-population-survey-2018/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/regional-employment-patterns-scotland-statistics-annual-population-survey-2018/)">^7</a>.</p>
          <p>The median gender pay gap in Scotland for full time workers is currently 5.7% in favour of men and rises to 15% when part-time workers are included[^8].

          <h3>Quality of Work</h3>
          <p>Despite strong headline labour market results, there are signs of fragility around the quality of work in our labour market. The proportion of Scotland’s workforce in full time work in 2018 remains below the pre-recession rate and has declined over the past 2 years[^2].</p>
          <p>And although the past decade has seen strong growth in roles defined as medium to high skill level[^3], analysis by the OECD concludes that employment growth in the UK between 2010-2017 was driven by sectors with below average productivity and wages[^4].</p>
          <p>A prolonged period of slow wage growth is reflected in the latest poverty data. Data for 2015-18, showed 60% of working-age adults in Scotland living in relative poverty after housing costs lived in working households - the highest on record.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is already acting to mitigate these challenges through our progressive Fair Work agenda, including the real Living Wage, and the Scottish Business Pledge. An initial assessment, published in the Tackling Child Poverty Progress Report, suggests that the Scottish Government invested over £1.4 billion in 2018-19 to support low income households. This includes the £100 million we invest each year to mitigate the worst impacts of UK Government welfare reforms.”</p>

          <h3>Global Climate Emergency</h3>
          <p>The Global Climate Emergency is one of the defining issues of our time and poses an unprecedented and fundamental threat to us all. We have set out the actions we will take to end Scotland’s contribution to the Global Climate Emergency and transition to net zero emissions including the Green New Deal to create the right conditions to kick-start investment and build the momentum needed for it to continue longer term.</p>
          <p>Analysis by the European Union suggests a move towards a net zero emissions economy will have a positive impact on employment in the UK<a href="[https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=738&amp;langId=en&amp;pubId=8219](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=738&amp;langId=en&amp;pubId=8219/)">^10</a>. However, the Scottish Government set up the Just Transition Commission to make recommendations how to understand and mitigate risks to regional cohesion, equalities, poverty and a sustainable and inclusive labour market of the shift towards a net zero emissions economy<a href="[https://www.gov.scot/groups/just-transition-commission/](https://www.gov.scot/groups/just-transition-commission/)">^11</a>.</p>
          <p>Through Skills Development Scotland, the Scottish Government has committed to develop a ‘Climate Emergency Skills Action Plan’ to ensure it is supporting market demand for the skills required to deliver net zero emissions. Looking ahead, it is essential that upskilling and retraining opportunities are available and that the skills system has the flexibility and agility required to adapt to changing conditions.</p>
          <h3>Technological Development</h3>
          <p>In 2018 the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the Scottish Trades Union Congress, published <em>Technological Change and the Scottish Labour Market</em><a href="[https://www.gov.scot/groups/just-transition-commission/](https://www.gov.scot/groups/just-transition-commission/)">^12</a> to better understand how the Scottish economy would be affected by developments in digital technology in years to come. While there is general consensus that some repetitive and administrative occupations and roles will be replaced – with those roles deemed most at risk - it is anticipated that new jobs will be created. Distributional impacts may be at the forefront of some of these changes<a href="[https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/women-automation-and-equality](https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/women-automation-and-equality/)">^13</a> with potentially unequal impacts on regions and by gender and ethnicity.</p>
          <p>The Trade Unions Congress<a href="[https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/IndustrialTransformationinPractice.pdf](https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/IndustrialTransformationinPractice.pdf)">^14</a> (TUC) recommended that delivering a national entitlement to skills, to give everyone the confidence to adapt to changing demands should be a key focus of a fair transition to an economy with greater use of technology.</p>
          <p>Recent research by Professor Ewart Keep for the Scottish Government’s Strategic Labour Market Group - The impact of digital innovation on education, training and skills - concluded that to prevent skills depreciation and to manage the future digital skills requirements of our economy, a renewed focus on lifelong learning with an adult learning system to suit is required.</p>
          <p>And alongside digital skills, a report published by Nesta  highlights that skills such as interpersonal skills, higher-order cognitive skills, and systems skills are likely to be in greater demand in the future<a href="[https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-future-of-skills-employment-in-2030](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-future-of-skills-employment-in-2030/)">^15</a>.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government acknowledges that to adapt to a changing and uncertain economic and technological landscape, individuals will need to develop their skills and adapt, perhaps on multiple occasions. While technology is likely to create uncertainty, it also presents opportunities. For example, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) – free web-based distance learning programmes - may play an increased role in future, offering a viable route for learners to develop their skills via remote e-learning.</p>
          <h3>International uncertainty and Brexit</h3>
          <p>In June 2019 the World Bank downgraded international growth forecasts for 2019 to 2.6%, rising to 2.7% in 2020 and 2.8% in 2021<a href="[https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/06/04/global-growth-to-weaken-to-26-in-2019-substantial-risks-seen](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/06/04/global-growth-to-weaken-to-26-in-2019-substantial-risks-seen/)">^16</a>. This unease has been exacerbated by the UK’s decision in 2016 to leave the European Union.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is clear that the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, in any form, will have a damaging effect on Scotland’s society and economy. Analysis by the Office of the Chief Economic Adviser suggests a ‘no deal’ Brexit could increase unemployment to around 8% - an additional 100,000 people out of work<a href="[https://www.gov.scot/publications/deal-brexit-economic-implications-scotland/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/deal-brexit-economic-implications-scotland/)">^17</a>.</p>
          <p>The sectors of our economy deemed most at risk from Brexit<a href="[https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/publication/2019/02/state-economy-february-2019/documents/brexit-scottish-sectoral-economic-impact-analysis/brexit-scottish-sectoral-economic-impact-analysis/govscot%3Adocument/00546072.pdf](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/publication/2019/02/state-economy-february-2019/documents/brexit-scottish-sectoral-economic-impact-analysis/brexit-scottish-sectoral-economic-impact-analysis/govscot%3Adocument/00546072.pdf)">^18</a>, such as manufacturing, where non-UK EU nationals make up relatively larger proportions of the workforce, may experience reduced labour supply and worsened skills gaps through reduced migration.</p>
          <p>In the longer term, Brexit may create a greater need for older workers to upskill and/or retrain if sectoral downturns lead to job losses. Workers leaving these industries may have highly specialised skills and require significant re-skilling to secure employment in other sectors.</p>

          <h3>Global Climate Emergency</h3>
          <p>The Global Climate Emergency is one of the defining issues of our time and poses an unprecedented and fundamental threat to us all. We have set out the actions we will take to end Scotland’s contribution to the Global Climate Emergency and transition to net zero emissions including the Green New Deal to create the right conditions to kick-start investment and build the momentum needed for it to continue longer term.</p>
          <p>Analysis by the European Union suggests a move towards a net zero emissions economy will have a positive impact on employment in the UK<a href="[https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=738&amp;langId=en&amp;pubId=8219](https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=738&amp;langId=en&amp;pubId=8219/)">^10</a>. However, the Scottish Government set up the Just Transition Commission to make recommendations how to understand and mitigate risks to regional cohesion, equalities, poverty and a sustainable and inclusive labour market of the shift towards a net zero emissions economy<a href="[https://www.gov.scot/groups/just-transition-commission/](https://www.gov.scot/groups/just-transition-commission/)">^11</a>.</p>
          <p>Through Skills Development Scotland, the Scottish Government has committed to develop a ‘Climate Emergency Skills Action Plan’ to ensure it is supporting market demand for the skills required to deliver net zero emissions. Looking ahead, it is essential that upskilling and retraining opportunities are available and that the skills system has the flexibility and agility required to adapt to changing conditions.</p>
          <h3>Technological Development</h3>
          <p>In 2018 the Scottish Government, in conjunction with the Scottish Trades Union Congress, published <em>Technological Change and the Scottish Labour Market</em><a href="[https://www.gov.scot/groups/just-transition-commission/](https://www.gov.scot/groups/just-transition-commission/)">^12</a> to better understand how the Scottish economy would be affected by developments in digital technology in years to come. While there is general consensus that some repetitive and administrative occupations and roles will be replaced – with those roles deemed most at risk - it is anticipated that new jobs will be created. Distributional impacts may be at the forefront of some of these changes<a href="[https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/women-automation-and-equality](https://www.ippr.org/research/publications/women-automation-and-equality/)">^13</a> with potentially unequal impacts on regions and by gender and ethnicity.</p>
          <p>The Trade Unions Congress<a href="[https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/IndustrialTransformationinPractice.pdf](https://www.tuc.org.uk/sites/default/files/IndustrialTransformationinPractice.pdf)">^14</a> (TUC) recommended that delivering a national entitlement to skills, to give everyone the confidence to adapt to changing demands should be a key focus of a fair transition to an economy with greater use of technology.</p>
          <p>Recent research by Professor Ewart Keep for the Scottish Government’s Strategic Labour Market Group - The impact of digital innovation on education, training and skills - concluded that to prevent skills depreciation and to manage the future digital skills requirements of our economy, a renewed focus on lifelong learning with an adult learning system to suit is required.</p>
          <p>And alongside digital skills, a report published by Nesta  highlights that skills such as interpersonal skills, higher-order cognitive skills, and systems skills are likely to be in greater demand in the future<a href="[https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-future-of-skills-employment-in-2030](https://www.nesta.org.uk/report/the-future-of-skills-employment-in-2030/)">^15</a>.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government acknowledges that to adapt to a changing and uncertain economic and technological landscape, individuals will need to develop their skills and adapt, perhaps on multiple occasions. While technology is likely to create uncertainty, it also presents opportunities. For example, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) – free web-based distance learning programmes - may play an increased role in future, offering a viable route for learners to develop their skills via remote e-learning.</p>
          <h3>International uncertainty and Brexit</h3>
          <p>In June 2019 the World Bank downgraded international growth forecasts for 2019 to 2.6%, rising to 2.7% in 2020 and 2.8% in 2021<a href="[https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/06/04/global-growth-to-weaken-to-26-in-2019-substantial-risks-seen](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2019/06/04/global-growth-to-weaken-to-26-in-2019-substantial-risks-seen/)">^16</a>. This unease has been exacerbated by the UK’s decision in 2016 to leave the European Union.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is clear that the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, in any form, will have a damaging effect on Scotland’s society and economy. Analysis by the Office of the Chief Economic Adviser suggests a ‘no deal’ Brexit could increase unemployment to around 8% - an additional 100,000 people out of work<a href="[https://www.gov.scot/publications/deal-brexit-economic-implications-scotland/](https://www.gov.scot/publications/deal-brexit-economic-implications-scotland/)">^17</a>.</p>
          <p>The sectors of our economy deemed most at risk from Brexit<a href="[https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/publication/2019/02/state-economy-february-2019/documents/brexit-scottish-sectoral-economic-impact-analysis/brexit-scottish-sectoral-economic-impact-analysis/govscot%3Adocument/00546072.pdf](https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/publication/2019/02/state-economy-february-2019/documents/brexit-scottish-sectoral-economic-impact-analysis/brexit-scottish-sectoral-economic-impact-analysis/govscot%3Adocument/00546072.pdf)">^18</a>, such as manufacturing, where non-UK EU nationals make up relatively larger proportions of the workforce, may experience reduced labour supply and worsened skills gaps through reduced migration.</p>
          <p>In the longer term, Brexit may create a greater need for older workers to upskill and/or retrain if sectoral downturns lead to job losses. Workers leaving these industries may have highly specialised skills and require significant re-skilling to secure employment in other sectors.</p>
