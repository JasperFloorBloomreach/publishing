          * **Significantly reducing or abolishing business rates for 100,000 premises**

          <h2>Competitive and stable tax system</h2>
          <p>We know that businesses want a competitive and stable tax system, streamlined and simple information, advice and support, and appropriate and proportionate regulation. We are taking action to deliver this supportive business environment and are committing to a competitive and stable fiscal regime.</p>
          <h2>Business rates</h2>
          <p>We have significantly reduced or abolished business rates for over 100,000 premises – saving small businesses almost £1.5 billion cumulatively since 2008  – and are providing an extra £100 million of business rate support in 2018-19, including a new Growth Accelerator. This measure, unique in the UK, suspends the non-domestic rates liability for new build properties until 12 months after they are first occupied and ensures improved properties will not see increases in their rates bill resulting from the improvements until one year after completion of the works.</p>
          <p>We will bring forward a Non-Domestic Rates Bill to implement the agreed recommendations of the Barclay Review that require primary legislation in early 2019 such as the move to three-yearly revaluations from 2022, a move widely welcomed by business. We will also ensure that tax decisions in the forthcoming Budget embed Scotland’s competitive position as an attractive place to do business and provide certainty to investors.</p>

          <h2>Enterprise Agencies</h2>
          <p>We provide over £250 million each year to support Scottish Enterprise to promote sustainable and inclusive growth through providing practical support and opportunities for sectors and businesses to develop, grow and invest in Scotland; and a further £71m goes to Highlands and Islands Enterprise to provide tailored support across the region.</p>
          <h2>Information, advice and support</h2>
          <p>We will maximise the impact of the investment we make in enterprise and skills development by implementing the recommendations of the business-led <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/groups/enterprise-and-skills-strategic-board/">Strategic Board</a> and ensuring our agencies operate as a single system that delivers the right information, advice and support at the right time for business. This includes building on the established success of the Partnership Action for Continued Employment (PACE) model by enhancing data-led analysis of sectoral and company resilience, to deliver through agencies a consistent yet targeted service to companies across Scotland, when they need support.</p>
          <h2>Leadership</h2>
          <p>We will also task the agencies to work with Scotland’s wide range of leadership and enterprise support organisations as well as business, employers, and colleges and universities, especially business schools, to develop and deliver a range of different types of leadership and management support which meet the needs of individuals and businesses at different stages of career development and company growth.</p>
          <h2>Single Digital Portal</h2>
          <p>We will improve and speed up access to and decision making on support for businesses – including implementing a single digital portal with online needs assessment and instant decisions on eligibility based financial support.</p>

          <h2>Enterprise Agencies</h2>
          <p>We provide over £250 million each year to support Scottish Enterprise to promote sustainable and inclusive growth through providing practical support and opportunities for sectors and businesses to develop, grow and invest in Scotland; and a further £71m goes to Highlands and Islands Enterprise to provide tailored support across the region.</p>
          <h2>Information, advice and support</h2>
          <p>We will maximise the impact of the investment we make in enterprise and skills development by implementing the recommendations of the business-led <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/groups/enterprise-and-skills-strategic-board/">Strategic Board</a> and ensuring our agencies operate as a single system that delivers the right information, advice and support at the right time for business. This includes building on the established success of the Partnership Action for Continued Employment (PACE) model by enhancing data-led analysis of sectoral and company resilience, to deliver through agencies a consistent yet targeted service to companies across Scotland, when they need support.</p>
          <h2>Leadership</h2>
          <p>We will also task the agencies to work with Scotland’s wide range of leadership and enterprise support organisations as well as business, employers, and colleges and universities, especially business schools, to develop and deliver a range of different types of leadership and management support which meet the needs of individuals and businesses at different stages of career development and company growth.</p>
          <h2>Single Digital Portal</h2>
          <p>We will improve and speed up access to and decision making on support for businesses – including implementing a single digital portal with online needs assessment and instant decisions on eligibility based financial support.</p>

Our aim is for the Bank to be investing in our businesses, communities and transformative projects from 2020 to promote innovative, carbon neutral and inclusive growth.</p>

          <p>To improve access to finance for Scottish businesses and transformative projects, we will introduce legislation to enable the establishment and capitalisation of the <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/scottish-national-investment-bank-implementation-plan/">Scottish National Investment Bank</a>. Our aim is for the Bank to be investing in our businesses, communities and transformative projects from 2020 to promote innovative, carbon neutral and inclusive growth.</p>
          <h2>Building Scotland Fund</h2>
          <p>As a precursor to this, the £150 million <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/building-scotland-fund/">Building Scotland Fund</a> will provide £70 million in 2018 to 2019 and £80 million over 2019 to 2021 to:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the development of new affordable and private sector housing;</li>
          <li>the development of modern industrial and commercial property;</li>
          <li>support industry-led research and development.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Scottish Growth Scheme</h2>
          <p>We will also stimulate private and partner investment in innovative and ambitious SMEs by providing microfinance, debt and equity support through the <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/scottish-growth-scheme/">Scottish Growth Scheme</a>. The Scheme has already supported some £125m of investment in businesses and will deliver up to £500m by June 2020.</p>

          * **Expanding the ‘Can Do’ approach**
          * **The £4m Unlocking Ambition Challenge is backing 40 high potential entrepreneurs to grow their business**
          <hr>
          <h2>Scotland ‘Can Do’</h2>
          <p><a href="http://www.cando.scot/">Scotland ‘Can Do’</a> seeks to make Scotland a world leading entrepreneurial and innovative nation. We have worked closely with Entrepreneurial Scotland and other partners in the public and private sectors to develop the ‘Can Do’ approach to entrepreneurship and the ‘Can Do’ brand.</p>
          <p>This approach – along with the combined efforts of the entrepreneurial community – has seen Scotland’s support ecosystem ranked as the 5th most effective globally, up from 13th in 2013, and a doubling of the proportion of Scots actively trying to start a business. We will build on this positive momentum by asking the enterprise agencies to expand, enhance and support the Can Do approach still further and broadening our collective efforts to address the needs of women in enterprise and the Creative sector.</p>
          <h2>Unlocking Ambition Challenge</h2>
          <p>Through the Unlocking Ambition Challenge we will provide up to 40 budding entrepreneurs each year with the best possible advice and support, including tailored training; mentoring from successful business leaders, and access to professional, financial and entrepreneurial networks to help them grow their business.</p>
          <p>This builds on the success of programs such as Converge Challenge and <a href="https://scottishedge.com/">Scottish EDGE</a>. Over the last six years, Converge Challenge, Scotland’s company creation programme for staff, students and recent graduates of Scottish Universities and Research Institutes has created more than 120 companies that have collectively secured £79 million in funding and have an 88% survival rate after three years. Meanwhile, the Scottish EDGE competition which identifies and supports entrepreneurs and start-ups has supported over 300 businesses to create over 1,300 new jobs.</p>
          <h2>Women in Enterprise</h2>
          <p>Our shared Women in Enterprise Action Framework seeks to realise untapped economic potential by tackling the gender gap across start-ups and growth companies. We are backing this up with support of £400k in 2018/19 for initiatives such as <a href="http://www.investingwomen.co.uk/">Investing Women</a>, the <a href="https://bwsltd.co.uk/">Business Women Scotland</a>’s Live Events programme, the <a href="https://www.wescotland.co.uk/ambassadors-role-models">Women's Enterprise Scotland Ambassadors Programme</a> and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce ‘Future Female Business Leaders’ programme.</p>
          <h2>Investing in talent</h2>
          <p>While it’s critical to broaden the pool of talent starting and growing new businesses, we need to ensure that we continue to invest in those businesses that have the potential for rapid growth - investing in people, funds and expertise where it can make the most difference. New data capability will enable the enterprise agencies to act on better intelligence to help drive business investment and growth.</p>

          * **Underwriting the future of aluminium production in Scotland**
          * **Investing in the future of commercial shipbuilding**
          * **Supporting the Scottish steel sector**
          <hr>
          <h2>Aluminium production in the Highlands</h2>
          <p>In November 2016, Rio Tinto Alcan sold the last remaining aluminium smelter in the UK, in Lochaber, to the GFG Alliance. The Scottish Government supported this transaction as part of a clear commitment to Scotland’s industrial infrastructure and rural economy and to inclusive and sustainable growth in the West Highlands. The continued operation of the smelter and further downstream investment will provide a critical manufacturing anchor creating opportunities in both the local and national economy.</p>
          <h2>Clyde shipbuilding</h2>
          <p>We are committed to doing all we can to ensure a sustainable future for commercial shipbuilding on the Clyde. Shipbuilding and the wider marine engineering sector play a vital role in sustaining many high-value jobs on the Clyde and elsewhere in Scotland. This is why, alongside investment from the business owners, we have provided commercial loan facilities of up £45 million to Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited to help the company strengthen and diversify its business.</p>
          <h2>Scottish Steel</h2>
          <p>We wish to see a sustainable future for the Scottish steel sector, building on the long and proud heritage of steelwork in Scotland. Scottish steel is a quality product, which includes the specialist heavy plate from Liberty Steel in Lanarkshire. We are working with the sector through the Scottish Steel Round Table, chaired by the Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, to do as much as we can to help lower the barriers to trade and to increase the industry’s ability to compete in local and global markets. The public sector in Scotland is itself a major customer for steel and our on-line Steel Pipeline publication highlights potential market opportunities for steel producers from public sector projects and programmes.</p>
          <p>Supporting these traditional industries is key part of our drive to build Scotland’s advanced manufacturing and data driven innovation opportunities.</p>

          <h2>Aluminium production in the Highlands</h2>
          <p>In November 2016, Rio Tinto Alcan sold the last remaining aluminium smelter in the UK, in Lochaber, to the GFG Alliance. The Scottish Government supported this transaction as part of a clear commitment to Scotland’s industrial infrastructure and rural economy and to inclusive and sustainable growth in the West Highlands. The continued operation of the smelter and further downstream investment will provide a critical manufacturing anchor creating opportunities in both the local and national economy.</p>
          <h2>Clyde shipbuilding</h2>
          <p>We are committed to doing all we can to ensure a sustainable future for commercial shipbuilding on the Clyde. Shipbuilding and the wider marine engineering sector play a vital role in sustaining many high-value jobs on the Clyde and elsewhere in Scotland. This is why, alongside investment from the business owners, we have provided commercial loan facilities of up £45 million to Ferguson Marine Engineering Limited to help the company strengthen and diversify its business.</p>

          <p>Scotland is an established, successful financial hub and the financial services sector plays a significant role in Scotland’s economy – both in its own right as one of our most significant employers, with 86,000 employed directly in the sector, and also as a driver and supporter of wider economic activity across the country.</p>
          <p>We will continue to work with the sector to attract new investment and jobs to Scotland, such as the recently announced Barclays expansion in Glasgow, supported by Scottish Enterprise, that will bring up to 2,500 jobs to Glasgow. Such investments will ensure that Scotland continues to be a major financial centre.</p>
          <h2>Financial Services Advisory Board</h2>
          <p>The <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/groups/fisab/">Financial Services Advisory Board</a> (FISAB) is co-chaired by the First Minister and Scottish Financial Enterprise, and we are now forming a new Banking and Economy Forum – chaired by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance, the Economy and Fair Work – to focus on the relationship between banking and the economy and the role of banking in Scotland.</p>
          <h2>FinTech</h2>
          <p>We will build on our support for financial technology (FinTech), through the newly-established <a href="https://www.fintechscotland.com/">FinTech Scotland</a>, to support innovation and diversity in the sector, taking full advantage of Scotland’s strength and history in finance and technology. Proposals to develop a Global Open Banking Centre of Excellence in Edinburgh, supported by FinTech Scotland, the University of Edinburgh and a broad spectrum of business and public sector partners is a prime example of how Scotland is seizing the opportunities offered by new technology and building on our well established strengths in financial services and technology. We will also support the Ethical Finance Hub.</p>

          * **Scotland’s creative industries contributed £4.4 billion of GVA to Scotland in 2016, employing 84,000 people**
          * **The creative sector promotes experimentation and idea generation, it helps drive innovation and transformation, and contributes to Scotland’s international reputation**
          <hr>
          <p>We will work with industry to promote the value of design, use of design thinking, and build design capability across sectors. We have supported the development of the iconic <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/dundee">V&amp;A Dundee</a>, Scotland’s first design museum, which will provide significant economic benefit through employment generation and contributing to Scotland’s international reputation.</p>

          <p>The health of the Scottish economy depends on having a diverse range of business types. Employee-ownership has an important role to play.</p>
          <h2>Scotland for EO</h2>
          <p>We are making it easier for companies and workers to find out more about employee-ownership and to move towards it if it’s right for them. Scotland for EO will help to make this into a real option for businesses and workers across Scotland.</p>
          <p>There are already around 100 employee-owned and worker-owned businesses operating in Scotland with approximately 7,000 employee-owners generating a combined turnover of around £940 million every year.</p>
          <p>We aim to increase the number of employee-owned and worker-owned businesses to 500 by 2030 through the newly-established ‘Scotland for EO’ – an industry leadership group with the aim of making Scotland the best country in the world for employee owned (EO) businesses.</p>
          <p>Scottish Enterprise is running a series of workshops explaining employee ownership to build awareness and demand for this inclusive business model.</p>

          * **Workshops for anyone interested in employee ownership**
          <hr>
          <p>The health of the Scottish economy depends on having a diverse range of business types. Employee-ownership has an important role to play.</p>
          <h2>Scotland for EO</h2>
          <p>We are making it easier for companies and workers to find out more about employee-ownership and to move towards it if it’s right for them. Scotland for EO will help to make this into a real option for businesses and workers across Scotland.</p>
          <p>There are already around 100 employee-owned and worker-owned businesses operating in Scotland with approximately 7,000 employee-owners generating a combined turnover of around £940 million every year.</p>
          <p>We aim to increase the number of employee-owned and worker-owned businesses to 500 by 2030 through the newly-established ‘Scotland for EO’ – an industry leadership group with the aim of making Scotland the best country in the world for employee owned (EO) businesses.</p>
          <p>Scottish Enterprise is running a series of workshops explaining employee ownership to build awareness and demand for this inclusive business model.</p>

          <h2>Enterprise Support</h2>
          <p>There is a greater proportion of microenterprises in rural Scotland than anywhere else in the country. By-and-large these enterprises operate a business model where profit margins and turnover are lower, they have slower trajectories for growth, and the levels of self-employment are higher. These enterprises play an important role in their local economy and are a major source of development with growth of £6.6 billion between 2007-2015. There is untapped potential in our rural economy as its true value to the economy of Scotland is under-represented in statistics due to turnover levels of some microenterprises falling below those required for VAT registration.</p>
          <p>We are delivering over £119 million of enterprise support through <a href="https://growbiz.co.uk/">GrowBiz</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.scot/Topics/farmingrural/SRDP/LEADER">LEADER</a>, <a href="http://www.hie.co.uk/">Highlands and Islands Enterprise</a> and <a href="https://www.scottish-enterprise.com/">Scottish Enterprise</a> to nearly 1,500 community based and/or micro enterprise projects operating in the rural economy.</p>

          <h2><em>case study:</em>{:.hidden} GrowBiz</h2>
          <p>Established in 2007, GrowBiz is a community-based enterprise support organisation located in Perthshire. It provides services across rural Perth &amp; Kinross, and increasingly to other parts of Scotland, and has engaged with more than 800 small and micro-businesses in the last two years.</p>
          <p>With funding and support from the Rural Perth &amp; Kinross LEADER programme, Scottish Government, Scottish Enterprise and Perth &amp; Kinross Council – and also private sector support from SSE and RBS - GrowBiz has created a unique model of enterprise support which has contributed to a more sustainable and diverse rural economy. It offers flexible and individually-tailored support to anyone wanting to start or grow a business, or social enterprise, contracting a team of freelance enterprise facilitators to provide specialist 1:1 support, responsive to local needs. Its peer learning and networking events have supported more than 2,500 individuals since 2017, and GrowBiz’s client businesses represent a wide diversity of sectors, including tourism, creative, digital services, care &amp; wellbeing and niche manufacturing.</p>
          <p>GrowBiz’s award-winning mentoring programme has trained more than 60 local mentors, and its Creative Care project has developed an innovative approach to delivering social care and wellbeing in rural areas through a network of micro-enterprises and self-employed carers – addressing issues of social isolation, as well as enabling elderly people to stay in their communities. One significant measure of the effectiveness of the GrowBiz model is the high survivability rates of businesses, with more than 95% of the businesses started with support from GrowBiz over the last four years continuing to trade.</p>

          <h2>Food and Drink</h2>
          <p>We have pledged £7.5m funding over 2017-2020 towards the Ambition 2030 Food and Drink Industry Strategy to help the sector double its turnover to £30bn by 2030. The strategy contains a range of actions with collaboration between government and industry to support food and drink businesses and help the sector grow. We have published, in collaboration with industry, a number of sectoral action plans covering: fruit and vegetables and potatoes; pigs; and venison; featuring a series of practical actions to drive economic growth in these sectors.</p>

          <p>In partnership with the social enterprise sector, we published a ten-year social enterprise strategy and, since 2009, we have invested almost £4 million in the Social Entrepreneurs Fund to support social enterprise activity. Highland and Islands Enterprise play a role in account managing and growing social enterprises.</p>
          <h2>Raising Awareness</h2>
          <p>We are using the <a href="https://yoyp2018.scot/">Year of Young People 2018</a> and our delivery of social enterprise activity in schools and early learning establishments across Scotland to raise awareness of social enterprise as a viable and rewarding career.</p>
          <p>We have doubled our seed funding for start-ups from £500,000 to £1 million through our national social enterprise incubator.</p>
          <h2>Community Shares Scotland</h2>
          <p>We provided over £134,000 funding in 2018-19 to expand the innovative <a href="http://communitysharesscotland.org.uk/">Community Shares Scotland</a> programme, which has helped social entrepreneurs raise more than £10 million for over 100 community projects since 2014.</p>

          * **Streamlined purchase to pay processes**
          * **Supporting small businesses and local supply chains**
          <hr>
          <p>To support businesses, we will review our own processes to increase the level of digital transactions to streamline our purchase to pay processes, including the deployment of digital invoicing techniques.</p>
          <p>We continue to focus on paying our bills quickly. Last year, the Scottish Government paid 99% of valid invoices within 10 days. We will continue to focus on this and deploy resources released from the deployment of digital invoicing techniques to improve the percentage of valid invoices.</p>
          <h2>Project Bank Accounts</h2>
          <p>To improve cash flow for sub-contractors who are critical in the delivery of infrastructure, our existing policy has resulted in the award of contracts worth around £100m for projects with Project Bank Accounts. We will review our Project Bank Account thresholds with a view to increasing the number of sub-contractors who can benefit from this approach.</p>
          <h2>Supply Chains</h2>
          <p>From January 2017 to March 2018 almost 700 SME sub-contractors, two-thirds of which are based in Scotland, won work in our supply chain worth £114 million. To extend these benefits to small businesses and local supply chains, we will:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>develop an easily accessible portal drawing together the support available for businesses who aspire to use public procurement as a means to facilitate growth;</li>
          <li>extend a requirement to use Public Contracts Scotland to facilitate access to sub-contract opportunities in major contracts for Scottish SMEs and the reporting of sub-contracted spend;</li>
          <li>continue to fund and support the Supplier Development Programme, helping local supply chains to maximise contracting and sub-contracting opportunities.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Digital Commercial Service</h2>
          <p>We will launch a Digital Commercial Service that builds on our CivTech model and offers new opportunities to engage with the public sector through agile procurement at greater scale. We will also continue to extend the range of Scottish Government and public sector contracts to which the fair work criteria will apply.</p>
