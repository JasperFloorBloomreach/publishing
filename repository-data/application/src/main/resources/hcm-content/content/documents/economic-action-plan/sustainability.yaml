          * **A £20 million Energy Investment Fund**
          * **A £60 million Low Carbon Innovation Fund**
          * **A Route Map on an Energy Efficient Scotland, that will lead to over £10 billion of activity to retrofit existing homes and buildings throughout all parts of Scotland**
          * **50% of Scotland’s energy needs met by renewables by 2030**
          * **£25m to support innovation in wave and tidal technologies**
          <hr>
          <h2>Energy Efficient Scotland Route Map</h2>
          <p>By 2030 the equivalent of 50% of the energy for Scotland’s heat, transport and electricity consumption is to be supplied from renewable sources, along with a 30% increase in the productivity of energy use across the Scottish economy. That is why we have made energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority and set out  our plans for this transformation in the <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/">Energy Efficient Scotland Route Map</a>.  We estimate this will result in a £10-12 billion programme of public and private sector investment over the next 20 years, with the potential to boost Scottish GDP growth and generate economic opportunity across the whole of Scotland.</p>
          <h2>Funding the transition to a carbon neutral economy</h2>
          <p>We have already allocated around £40 million to 16 low carbon capital projects through the Low Carbon Infrastructure Transition Programme. To progress our transition to a carbon neutral economy, we are providing support for renewable and local carbon infrastructure through our £20 million Energy Investment Fund and £60 million Low Carbon Innovation Fund.</p>
          <h2>Wave and Tidal Energy</h2>
          <p>To maintain Scotland’s position as a world leader in wave and tidal energy technologies, our <a href="http://www.waveenergyscotland.co.uk/">Wave Energy Scotland</a> programme has been designed to drive forward the search for innovative solutions. The programme has already made £25 million available to support 60 innovative projects, maximising the economic benefit of design, manufacturing and export. Our flagship wave and tidal test facility, the <a href="http://www.emec.org.uk/">European Marine Energy Centre</a> (EMEC), has over a decade of real-sea experience. We will also continue to support the expansion of offshore wind by providing new guidance to industry on licensing and decommissioning, as well as providing a further £2 million this year to support innovation and to help reduce business costs.</p>
          <h2>Electricity and Gas Networks</h2>
          <p>Electricity and gas network businesses in Scotland, and their supply chain, will be key to realising our transition to a carbon neutral economy. We are working with these companies, as well as the wider sector and the regulator, to ensure these future plans are aligned to our vision for the sector.</p>
          <div class="case-study" markdown="1">
          <h2><em>case study:</em>{:.hidden} Orkney Renewable Energy</h2>
          <p>Wind turbine power is a well-established technology in the Orkney islands. The islands are now at the forefront of efforts to develop commercially viable devices to harness wave and tidal energy resources. The European Marine Energy Centre in Stromness was established in 2003. These world-class test facilities, alongside a wealth of academic and maritime expertise and a growing number of specialist supply chain businesses, have helped make Orkney a global centre for renewable energy development.</p>
          <p>Improving facilities for the emerging renewables industry has been a top priority for local public sector organisations, with Orkney Islands Council investing in major new harbour developments at Hatston near Kirkwall, Lyness, on the island of Hoy, and Stromness. Meanwhile, Highlands and Islands Enterprise has created extensive on-shore facilities for developers at Hatston.</p>
          <p>The Orkney community has been quick to embrace the renewables industry, recognising its enormous economic potential, with increasing numbers of local businesses keen to diversify into the field. The creation of the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus in Stromness will provide accommodation for universities and for new occupants, including inward investors, existing Orkney companies expanding into new activities or markets, and new ventures formed to take up opportunities that emerge through R&amp;D undertaken at the campus.</p>
          <p>Community owned wind turbines in Orkney generate electricity, providing revenue to support local projects and address fuel poverty. Curtailment has resulted in communities becoming involved in highly innovative projects piloting hydrogen production and energy storage systems.</p>
          <p>Renewable energy now supports around 300 jobs in Orkney across a wide range of sectors, from manufacturing and engineering, to marine work, research and consultancy services, with additional posts being created every year. Orkney’s entire electricity needs are regularly met from local renewables sources.</p>

          * **A £20 million Energy Investment Fund**
          * **A £60 million Low Carbon Innovation Fund**
          * **A Route Map on an Energy Efficient Scotland, that will lead to over £10 billion of activity to retrofit existing homes and buildings throughout all parts of Scotland**
          * **50% of Scotland’s energy needs met by renewables by 2030**
          * **£25m to support innovation in wave and tidal technologies**
          <hr>
          <h2>Energy Efficient Scotland Route Map</h2>
          <p>By 2030 the equivalent of 50% of the energy for Scotland’s heat, transport and electricity consumption is to be supplied from renewable sources, along with a 30% increase in the productivity of energy use across the Scottish economy. That is why we have made energy efficiency a national infrastructure priority and set out  our plans for this transformation in the <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/publications/energy-efficient-scotland-route-map/">Energy Efficient Scotland Route Map</a>.  We estimate this will result in a £10-12 billion programme of public and private sector investment over the next 20 years, with the potential to boost Scottish GDP growth and generate economic opportunity across the whole of Scotland.</p>
          <h2>Funding the transition to a carbon neutral economy</h2>
          <p>We have already allocated around £40 million to 16 low carbon capital projects through the Low Carbon Infrastructure Transition Programme. To progress our transition to a carbon neutral economy, we are providing support for renewable and local carbon infrastructure through our £20 million Energy Investment Fund and £60 million Low Carbon Innovation Fund.</p>
          <h2>Wave and Tidal Energy</h2>
          <p>To maintain Scotland’s position as a world leader in wave and tidal energy technologies, our <a href="http://www.waveenergyscotland.co.uk/">Wave Energy Scotland</a> programme has been designed to drive forward the search for innovative solutions. The programme has already made £25 million available to support 60 innovative projects, maximising the economic benefit of design, manufacturing and export. Our flagship wave and tidal test facility, the <a href="http://www.emec.org.uk/">European Marine Energy Centre</a> (EMEC), has over a decade of real-sea experience. We will also continue to support the expansion of offshore wind by providing new guidance to industry on licensing and decommissioning, as well as providing a further £2 million this year to support innovation and to help reduce business costs.</p>
          <h2>Electricity and Gas Networks</h2>
          <p>Electricity and gas network businesses in Scotland, and their supply chain, will be key to realising our transition to a carbon neutral economy. We are working with these companies, as well as the wider sector and the regulator, to ensure these future plans are aligned to our vision for the sector.</p>

          <h2><em>case study:</em>{:.hidden} Orkney Renewable Energy</h2>
          <p>Wind turbine power is a well-established technology in the Orkney islands. The islands are now at the forefront of efforts to develop commercially viable devices to harness wave and tidal energy resources. The European Marine Energy Centre in Stromness was established in 2003. These world-class test facilities, alongside a wealth of academic and maritime expertise and a growing number of specialist supply chain businesses, have helped make Orkney a global centre for renewable energy development.</p>

          **A more circular economy will benefit:**
          <ul>
          <li><strong>The environment by cutting waste and carbon emissions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The economy by improving productivity and opening up new markets</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Communities by providing new local employment opportunities and lower cost options to access the goods we need</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          A circular economy fosters innovation and encourages the development of business models which re-use products and materials and create value where before there was waste. [Zero Waste Scotland](https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk) are encouraging the development of innovative new circular economic business models such as that developed by Moock Environmental that can potentially be used in high value industries and turn a waste product into an economic opportunity. We want Scotland to be involved in driving circular economy opportunities across all sectors of the economy.
          <h2>Deposit Return Scheme</h2>
          <p>We are taking action as a Government to enhance recycling, including designing a deposit return scheme which will deliver a step change in our recycling rate, prevent littering and create new opportunities within the Scottish economy. This will create an economic opportunity for both the reprocessing of material and its subsequent reuse by companies keen to respond to consumer interest in more recycled content.</p>
          <h2>Just Transition Commission</h2>
          <p>We are also establishing a Just Transition Commission to advise Scottish Ministers on adjusting to a more sustainable and resource-efficient economic model in a fair way which will help to tackle inequality and poverty, and promote a fair and inclusive jobs market.</p>

          **A more circular economy will benefit:**
          <ul>
          <li><strong>The environment by cutting waste and carbon emissions</strong></li>
          <li><strong>The economy by improving productivity and opening up new markets</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Communities by providing new local employment opportunities and lower cost options to access the goods we need</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <hr>
          A circular economy fosters innovation and encourages the development of business models which re-use products and materials and create value where before there was waste. [Zero Waste Scotland](https://www.zerowastescotland.org.uk) are encouraging the development of innovative new circular economic business models such as that developed by Moock Environmental that can potentially be used in high value industries and turn a waste product into an economic opportunity. We want Scotland to be involved in driving circular economy opportunities across all sectors of the economy.
          <h2>Deposit Return Scheme</h2>
          <p>We are taking action as a Government to enhance recycling, including designing a deposit return scheme which will deliver a step change in our recycling rate, prevent littering and create new opportunities within the Scottish economy. This will create an economic opportunity for both the reprocessing of material and its subsequent reuse by companies keen to respond to consumer interest in more recycled content.</p>
          <h2>Just Transition Commission</h2>
          <p>We are also establishing a Just Transition Commission to advise Scottish Ministers on adjusting to a more sustainable and resource-efficient economic model in a fair way which will help to tackle inequality and poverty, and promote a fair and inclusive jobs market.</p>

          * **Investment in Scotland’s natural assets – air, water, land and nature – will deliver a healthier and more prosperous Scotland**
          <hr>
          <h2>Natural Assets</h2>
          <p>High quality natural assets – like our water, air, soils and nature – are the cornerstones of our economy, culture and quality of life.</p>
          <p>We are developing an environment strategy to help co-ordinate action and guide future activity to ensure these precious assets are protected and enhanced.  This will be complemented by a strengthened regulatory framework for activities likely to cause environmental harm. This integrated framework will help the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to deliver proportionate, joined up, and outcome-focussed regulation, ensuring more effective and efficient protection of the environment, whilst reducing the regulatory burden on business.</p>
          <p>SEPA is supporting businesses to move beyond simply complying with environmental standards towards helping identify new opportunities which will generate innovation and investment.</p>
          <h2>Clean Air</h2>
          <p>Clean air is essential for our health, wellbeing and economic prosperity. We are carrying out a comprehensive review of ‘Cleaner Air for Scotland’ – Scotland’s air quality strategy – building on the progress made to date to ensure our air is of the highest quality.</p>
          <h2>Water Environment</h2>
          <p>We are protecting and improving our water environment through the River Basin Management Plans which will restore watercourses to a more natural condition, generating environmental and economic benefits including more opportunities for tourism and recreation.</p>
          <p>We will seek opportunities to ensure that where possible various funding streams operate in tandem to achieve maximum benefits. <a href="https://www.sepa.org.uk/">Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA)</a>’s Water Environment Fund delivers around 40 river improvement projects each year, opening up many hundreds of kilometres of river for migratory fish, bringing associated economic benefits. The <a href="https://www.greeninfrastructurescotland.scot/">Green Infrastructure Fund</a> delivers some 15 projects across Scotland creating or enhancing around 140 hectares of greenspace in our towns and cities. The <a href="http://www.centralscotlandgreennetwork.org/">Central Scotland Green Network</a> is a long-term project, working with 19 local authorities to create green space across the central belt, estimated to deliver multiple benefits in excess of £6 billion over the next 35 years.</p>
          <p>We will explore where these 3 funds can be brought together to optimise the benefits such projects can bring to urban communities, regenerating those most deprived areas and bringing both health and economic benefits.</p>
          <h2>Soil Quality</h2>
          <p>Substantial investment has been made in improving our soil quality, through for example the Peatlands Action Fund which SNH are delivering, which restores degraded peatland so that it can store more carbon in future, with associated climate change benefits. And the Scottish Land Commission is working with SEPA to unlock potential growth by bringing vacant and derelict land back into economic use.</p>
          <h2>Forestry</h2>
          <p>Alongside this, we are committed to meeting our target of planting 10,000 hectares of woodland every year, and increase this by a further 50% by 2025; and we will deliver a new Scottish Forestry Strategy setting out the long-term vision and objectives for forestry and woodlands, including in support of the forestry sector which makes a substantial contribution to our economy.</p>
          <p>The Cairngorms National Park, Loch Lomond &amp; The Trossachs National Park and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh are playing a key role in supporting the strong growth in the tourism sector.</p>
          <p>We are continuing to invest in our green infrastructure to support tourism growth, such as the National Walking and Cycling Network which is attracting more visitors and generating £85 million expenditure in the local economy.</p>

          <h2>Ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEV)</h2>
          <p>We want Scotland to be at the forefront of growth in ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEV) markets, to ensure our business community and workforce benefit from the opportunities that new markets and technologies present.</p>
          <h2>Charging network</h2>
          <p>This year we are making available almost £50m to continue to support the take up of low emission vehicles and expand Scotland’s electric vehicle (EV) charging network (<a href="https://chargeplacescotland.org/">Charge Place Scotland</a>). This includes important initiatives such as the Electric A9 which will see us work with our stakeholders to support new commercial opportunities while delivering benefits to consumers and integrating EVs into our electricity networks.</p>
          <p>In collaboration with our enterprise agencies, we will invest in emerging research and commercial opportunities, with a particular emphasis on testing and demonstration facilities and innovation at the interface between energy and mobility.</p>
          <p>In collaboration with the energy network operators, we will support opportunities for data-driven innovation to influence and manage consumer energy demand and to improve network management. To capitalise on Scotland’s internationally significant hydrogen projects and pilots, we will set in place a coordinated programme of work to upscale opportunities across emerging hydrogen transport markets.</p>
          <h2>Driverless cars</h2>
          <p>We will also continue to encourage and support ongoing research, development, demonstration, and deployment of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) or driverless cars. For example, we are holding a two-day ‘CAV Scotland’ event taking place at the Royal Highland Centre on 30 October and 1 November this year (2018) and supporting a collaborative bid to InnovateUK’s ‘CAV4’ call for funding of an autonomous bus demonstrator. We are also partnering with INRIX on their ‘AV Road Rules’ platform to digitise part of the trunk road network and provide key data on road characteristics and encourage autonomous vehicle developers to bring trials and innovative technologies to Scotland.</p>
