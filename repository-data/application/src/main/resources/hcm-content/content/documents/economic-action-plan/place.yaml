          <p>We will use the National Planning Framework 4 to promote sustainable and inclusive economic growth across all of our regions, and to create high-quality, diverse and sustainable places that promote wellbeing and attract investment.</p>
          <h2>Strategic Transport Projects Review</h2>
          <p>Future transport investment through <a href="https://www.transport.gov.scot/our-approach/strategy/strategic-transport-projects-review/#">Strategic Transport Projects Review</a> (STPR2), will be aligned with the national planning framework, creating well connected places for the people of Scotland.</p>
          <h2>Planning Fees Regulations</h2>
          <p>We will consult on a review of our planning fees regulations, including the principle for a developer to pay a higher planning application fee for an accelerated service from the planning authority in its handling of the application.</p>
          <h2>Place Principle</h2>
          <p>We will support and promote the Place Principle which asks that all those responsible for providing services and looking after assets in a place work and plan together, with local communities, to create more successful places.</p>
          <p>Through the <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/improving-public-services/local-governance-review/">Local Governance Review</a>, we will consider proposals for alternative governance arrangements at local council / Community Planning Partnership level, or more regionally. A key objective will be to help drive inclusive growth in those places.</p>

          * **We will support the development of a diverse and healthy rural economy through the growth of traditional and non-traditional sectors**
          * **We will invest in our infrastructure to deliver housing, improved access to services and connectivity enabling improved sustainable and inclusive economic growth**
          * **We will deliver a rural skills action plan to ensure that rural enterprises have access to a highly-skilled workforce**
          <hr>
          <p>Nearly 20% of our population lives in rural Scotland.  There are higher proportions of microenterprises and 34% of Scotland’s social enterprises are located in rural areas. Whilst our rural economy is similar to and tightly integrated with the urban economy, there are differences in terms of employment patterns, distances from services and markets, and sparsity of populations. These differences mean that the way services and policies are delivered needs to be tailored to the local situation.</p>
          <p>Similarly, we are committed to supporting, strengthening and protecting island communities, and our historic Islands (Scotland) Act will help create the right environment for sustainable growth and empowered communities.</p>
          <h2>Scottish Rural Parliament</h2>
          <p>We established a <a href="https://www.scottishruralparliament.org.uk/">Scottish Rural Parliament</a> that has empowered rural communities across Scotland by giving them a stronger voice to initiate change at a local and national level.</p>
          <h2>Scottish Rural Development Programme</h2>
          <p>We have provided over £750 million of support to over 10,000 individual projects across Scotland through the <a href="https://www.ruralnetwork.scot/funding/scottish-rural-development-programme">Scottish Rural Development Programme</a>; including over 240 LEADER projects to encourage communities and individuals to develop projects to meet local needs.</p>
          <h2>Transport</h2>
          <p>We are working collaboratively with Regional Transport Partnerships, Scottish Rural Action and other key rural stakeholders to ensure that rural needs are being captured as part of the development of policies that will underpin the new National Transport Strategy to be published by the end of 2019.</p>
          <p>We have ambitious plans to dual the A9 and A96 and have successfully reintroduced a passenger rail service to the Borders for the first time since 1969. We will examine the case for an extension of the railway along with improvements to the A1, A7, and A68.</p>
          <h2>Digital Connectivity</h2>
          <p>We have exceeded our target of providing fibre broadband to 95% of premises across Scotland through the Digital Scotland Superfast Broadband (DSSB) programme. As a direct result of DSSB, we have provided access to broadband across Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles, areas which would otherwise have failed to be connected if left to the market. We will provide Scotland with a truly national, future-proofed digital infrastructure through our Reaching 100% programme, enabling us to capitalise on emerging digital opportunities and ensuring everyone has access to superfast broadband.</p>
          <p>Commercial investment has led to 95% of Scotland’s population having access to 4G however, only 36% of Scotland’s landmass was served. We are extending rural Scotland’s 4G coverage into longstanding ‘notspots’ through our Scottish 4G Infill (S4GI) Programme; investing £25 million (including £10M from ERDF sources).</p>
          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <p>We will publish and implement a rural skills action plan that will seek to ensure that national skills frameworks are available across rural Scotland. We will extend the Ringlink pre-apprenticeship programme to 4 other parts of rural Scotland over the next 3 years on a pilot basis.</p>
          <p>We will work with Scottish Enterprise to maximise the impact of the Rural Leadership Programme. We will draw upon graduates’ skills enabling them to: become pacesetters in their sectors and communities, stimulating business innovation, creativity, know-how and collaboration; and contribute to the development of initiatives that will unleash the potential of young people in rural communities to support them into positive destinations.</p>

          <h2><em>case study:</em>{:.hidden} Harris</h2>
          <p>In 2002, the community company North Harris Trust (NHT) was formed to purchase the North Harris Estate and move it into community ownership.  In 2005 the neighbouring 3 ha Seaforth Estate was similarly acquired, followed in 2013 by the addition of Scalpay Island, which had been gifted by the then owner to the residents of the island, but which the people chose, through a community ballot, to assimilate into North Harris Estate. The total land mass of the estate is 25,900ha. The land acquisitions by NHT were a significant catalyst for the economic and social growth of Harris .</p>
          <p>North Harris Trust’s stated aims are: to increase employment opportunities; address local housing needs; and protect and enhance natural and cultural heritage.</p>
          <p>A vital characteristic of the culture of Harris has been the ability to bring local and external stakeholders together around a vision for a more vibrant Harris, with economic opportunities helping to retain and grow the population of the area.  NHT works closely with SNH, the John Muir Trust and RSBP to manage environmentally important areas of the Estate, including designated areas recognised for the quality of their landscape or wildlife.  NHT also liaises with the local housing associations, Hebridean Housing Partnership (HHP) and Tighean Innse Gall, local grazings committees, and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to deliver its housing ambitions.  NHT is account managed by HIE to deliver a plan for growth.</p>
          <p>North Harris Trust is also currently an active partner on the Harris Forum which brings together community stakeholders to develop and implement a Harris wide Plan.  This process, which extends beyond the Estate is supported by HIE through a Community Account Management relationship, with Harris Development Ltd as the ‘lead’ or ‘anchor’ organisation.  The CPP has, on the strength of this forum, selected Harris as a pilot into a place based collaborative focus.</p>
          <p>In pursuit of its aims for the estate and the community living on it, NHT has made significant achievements to date, providing 2 new homes on Scalpay and in partnership with HHP developed 8 houses in North Harris.  Further housing developments are planned.  It has also provided 3 high specification business units which are fully occupied and providing jobs in the community and rental income to the estate.  It has ambitions for more and is testing the market for the most appropriate type and location.  In addition NHT has created 8 jobs at the Trust including a land manager post with responsibility for stewardship of nationally and internationally designated areas of North Harris and of running the annual mountain festival.  Tourism developments include the popular eagle observatory, path networks, a campervan site at the remote village of Huisinis and the most recent project, an observatory and viewing area within a woodland trail at the northern edge of the Estate.  In partnership with a private developer, a hydro scheme and 3 turbines have been completed which will in time generate income for the community.  The needs of young families have been catered for through the purchase of an old school for conversion into a soft play facility.</p>
          <p>HIE support to the people in the estate area extends beyond the direct support to NHT.  Harris Development Ltd has received support to deliver two new marina facilities at Scalpay and Tarbert and support through the private sector, includes the development of the highly successful Harris Distillery which now employs 30 people.</p>

          <p>A vital characteristic of the culture of Harris has been the ability to bring local and external stakeholders together around a vision for a more vibrant Harris, with economic opportunities helping to retain and grow the population of the area.  NHT works closely with SNH, the John Muir Trust and RSBP to manage environmentally important areas of the Estate, including designated areas recognised for the quality of their landscape or wildlife.  NHT also liaises with the local housing associations, Hebridean Housing Partnership (HHP) and Tighean Innse Gall, local grazings committees, and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to deliver its housing ambitions.  NHT is account managed by HIE to deliver a plan for growth.</p>
          <p>North Harris Trust is also currently an active partner on the Harris Forum which brings together community stakeholders to develop and implement a Harris wide Plan.  This process, which extends beyond the Estate is supported by HIE through a Community Account Management relationship, with Harris Development Ltd as the ‘lead’ or ‘anchor’ organisation.  The CPP has, on the strength of this forum, selected Harris as a pilot into a place based collaborative focus.</p>
          <p>In pursuit of its aims for the estate and the community living on it, NHT has made significant achievements to date, providing 2 new homes on Scalpay and in partnership with HHP developed 8 houses in North Harris.  Further housing developments are planned.  It has also provided 3 high specification business units which are fully occupied and providing jobs in the community and rental income to the estate.  It has ambitions for more and is testing the market for the most appropriate type and location.  In addition NHT has created 8 jobs at the Trust including a land manager post with responsibility for stewardship of nationally and internationally designated areas of North Harris and of running the annual mountain festival.  Tourism developments include the popular eagle observatory, path networks, a campervan site at the remote village of Huisinis and the most recent project, an observatory and viewing area within a woodland trail at the northern edge of the Estate.  In partnership with a private developer, a hydro scheme and 3 turbines have been completed which will in time generate income for the community.  The needs of young families have been catered for through the purchase of an old school for conversion into a soft play facility.</p>
          <p>HIE support to the people in the estate area extends beyond the direct support to NHT.  Harris Development Ltd has received support to deliver two new marina facilities at Scalpay and Tarbert and support through the private sector, includes the development of the highly successful Harris Distillery which now employs 30 people.</p>

          * **Developing Regional Marine Plans**
          * **A new, world-leading approach to management of our sea fisheries**
          * **Continued to support the sustainable growth of the aquaculture sector**
          <hr>
          <h2>Innovation, Technology and Skills</h2>
          <p>The Highlands and Islands of Scotland are uniquely placed to take advantage of the considerable growth potential in the marine economy. The region has extremely valuable natural assets, including 61% of the UK coastline, combined with innovative businesses, outstanding research capability, a skilled workforce and an international reputation and market reach.  The potential of the marine economy has already been demonstrated within the wave and tidal energy sector by the world-leading <a href="http://www.emec.org.uk/">The European Marine Energy Centre</a> in Orkney, and there is now a significant opportunity to build on this through an increased focus on aquaculture and marine biotechnology.</p>
          <p>Building on Highlands and Islands Enterprise’s “MAXiMAR” Science and Innovation audit, HIE will seek to maximise the region's marine innovation, technology and skills, not only for the benefit of the Highlands and Islands, but for the whole of the UK.</p>
          <h2>Regional Marine Plans</h2>
          <p>We are developing Regional Marine Plans which are delegated to partnerships at a local level leading to increased local transparency.  The Regional Marine Plans can focus on the specific rural issues in their region.</p>
          <h2>Offshore Wind</h2>
          <p>We will continue to support the expansion of offshore wind through providing new guidance to industry on licensing and decommissioning, as well as providing a further £2 million this year to support innovation and help reduce costs.</p>
          <h2>Fisheries</h2>
          <p>We are developing a new approach to fisheries management in partnership with the fishing industry and other stakeholders, establishing a world leading, sustainable fisheries management strategy, with inclusive economic growth at its heart. We also continue to support the sustainable growth of the aquaculture sector through joint work with the Aquaculture Industry Leadership Group, collaboration with other key regulators such as SEPA, SNH and local planning authorities to improve regulatory processes, development of the farmed fish health framework and through support for the Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre.</p>
          <p>We have supported maritime business and coastal communities through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, with £54m having been awarded since January 2016.</p>

          * **Increasing shared ownership of renewable energy**
          * **Giving local communities control of land and properties**
          <hr>
          <h2>Community and Renewable Energy Scheme</h2>
          <p>The new Community and Renewable Energy Scheme, worth £10 million per year, supports the development of shared ownership opportunities and we are publishing our review of Good Practice Principles for Shared Ownership of Onshore Renewable Energy Projects.</p>
          <h2>Towns</h2>
          <p>We will continue to support <a href="https://www.scotlandstowns.org/">Scotland's Towns</a> Partnership to promote the Town Centre First Principle and provide support and services which contribute to the vibrancy, vitality and viability of town centres and neighbourhoods.</p>
          <p>Building on the Town Centre First Principle, we will support and promote the Place Principle which asks that all those responsible for providing services and looking after assets in a place need to work and plan together, and with local communities, to improve the lives of people, support inclusive growth and create more successful places.</p>
          <h2>Asset Transfer</h2>
          <p>Asset Transfer legislation gives community organisations a right to ask to take over control of land or buildings owned by local councils, Scottish Government, and other public authorities – this is helping revitalise local economies by putting control of these properties into community hands and supporting community development</p>
          <p>We are supporting communities to become more resilient and sustainable through the ownership and management of land and land assets, with our £10 million per year <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/land-reform/scottish-land-fund/">Scottish Land Fund</a> extended to 2021.</p>
          <h2>Food and Drink</h2>
          <p>We have launched a <a href="https://connectlocal.scot/funding/regional-food-fund/">Regional Food Fund</a> of £250k to support growth in Scotland’s local/regional food and drink sector to double the amount that visitors spend on food and drink.</p>
          <p>We have provided support for the <a href="http://www.candoplaces.org/">Can Do Places</a> initiative, which supports the creation of co-working spaces that benefit communities, amounting to £150,000 from 2016 to 2017.</p>

          * **Increasing shared ownership of renewable energy**
          * **Giving local communities control of land and properties**
          <hr>
          <h2>Community and Renewable Energy Scheme</h2>
          <p>The new Community and Renewable Energy Scheme, worth £10 million per year, supports the development of shared ownership opportunities and we are publishing our review of Good Practice Principles for Shared Ownership of Onshore Renewable Energy Projects.</p>
          <h2>Towns</h2>
          <p>We will continue to support <a href="https://www.scotlandstowns.org/">Scotland's Towns</a> Partnership to promote the Town Centre First Principle and provide support and services which contribute to the vibrancy, vitality and viability of town centres and neighbourhoods.</p>
          <p>Building on the Town Centre First Principle, we will support and promote the Place Principle which asks that all those responsible for providing services and looking after assets in a place need to work and plan together, and with local communities, to improve the lives of people, support inclusive growth and create more successful places.</p>
          <h2>Asset Transfer</h2>
          <p>Asset Transfer legislation gives community organisations a right to ask to take over control of land or buildings owned by local councils, Scottish Government, and other public authorities – this is helping revitalise local economies by putting control of these properties into community hands and supporting community development</p>
          <p>We are supporting communities to become more resilient and sustainable through the ownership and management of land and land assets, with our £10 million per year <a href="https://beta.gov.scot/policies/land-reform/scottish-land-fund/">Scottish Land Fund</a> extended to 2021.</p>
          <h2>Food and Drink</h2>
          <p>We have launched a <a href="https://connectlocal.scot/funding/regional-food-fund/">Regional Food Fund</a> of £250k to support growth in Scotland’s local/regional food and drink sector to double the amount that visitors spend on food and drink.</p>
          <p>We have provided support for the <a href="http://www.candoplaces.org/">Can Do Places</a> initiative, which supports the creation of co-working spaces that benefit communities, amounting to £150,000 from 2016 to 2017.</p>
